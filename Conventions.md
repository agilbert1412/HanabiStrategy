# Conventions

## Introduction

A convention is a strategy that is not believed to be objectively better than alternatives, but in situation where no option is known to be better, the team wants to agree on a strategy among each other, because there is value in agreeing.

Independant groups can come up with wildly different conventions and have very similar efficiencies.

It is believed that for most conventions, there IS an objectively best choice, but we don't know which one it is at the moment.
With sufficient analysis and calculations, some conventions can become techniques.

This is a list of all of our agreed-upon conventions
