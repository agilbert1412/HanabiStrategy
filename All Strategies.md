## List of Strategies

### [1 - The Chop](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%201%20-%20First%20Principles/1%20-%20The%20Chop.md)
* When you discard an unknown card, always choose the oldest unclued card in your hand. Always pick up new cards on the same side to make this easy to track.

### [2 - Good Touch Principle](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%201%20-%20First%20Principles/2%20-%20The%20Good%20Touch%20Principle.md)
* All clues should, within reason, only touch cards that will be played at some point later, or if they are trash, it must be immediately obvious to the receiver.

### [3 - The Focus](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%201%20-%20First%20Principles/3%20-%20The%20Focus.md)
* For a given clue, only one card is garanteed to be important right now. If the chop was touched, it is the focus. Otherwise, the focus is the newest card that was unclued before that clue.

### [4 - Save Principle](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%201%20-%20First%20Principles/4%20-%20Save%20Principle.md)
* The last copy of a card should not be discarded. Any clue that focuses the chop and could be a Save clue should be considered as such until more information is acquired.
	
### [5 - Delayed Play Clue](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%201%20-%20First%20Principles/5%20-%20Delayed%20Play%20Clue.md)
* When a play clue is given, it could require any of the already to-be-played cards to work, so should wait until all potentially required cards are played

### [6 - Trust Your Team](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%201%20-%20First%20Principles/6%20-%20Trust%20Your%20Team.md)
* Assume your team mates are smart, don't make mistakes, and are choosing the best move on every turn

### [7 - Fix Clue](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%201%20-%20First%20Principles/7%20-%20Fix%20Clue.md)
* If you know a misplay is about to happen right now, spend a clue to fix it with information that contradicts what the person believed to be true. If you get a clue that contradict something you were sure to know, it is a Fix Clue.

### [8 - Discard Principle](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%201%20-%20First%20Principles/8%20-%20Discard%20Principle.md)
* Discarding should be a last resort action, the group is allowed very few discards to be able to get max score. If there is anything better to do, you should do that instead

### [9 - Early Game](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/9%20-%20Early%20Game.md)
* When you discard an unknown card, always choose the oldest unclued card in your hand. Always pick up new cards on the same side to make this easy to track.

### [10 - The Prompt](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/10%20-%20The%20Prompt.md)
* Give a Play Clue to a higher-ranked card to notice someone that one of their clued cards goes in-between. Play the newest clued card that could be what is needed when someone prompts you.

### [11 - The Finesse](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/11%20-%20The%20Finesse.md)
* Same as Prompt, except none of the clued cards match the expected card. Then play your newest unclued card. Give out finesses to get new unclued cards played for free.

### [12 - Starting 1s](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/12%20-%20Starting%201s.md)
* If you have multiple playable 1s, play the ones that were not in your starting hand, from newest to oldest, then the ones that were in your starting hand, from oldest to newest

### [13 - Reverse Finesse](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/13%20-%20Reverse%20Finesse.md)
* When you receive a play clue, look around to see if it could be a finesse or a prompt. If it could be, delay playing for one turn to see if anyone sitting after you responds to it. Play afterwards.

### [14 - Prompt Finesse](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/14%20-%20Prompt%20Finesse.md)
* If you get prompted, an it works, but isn't the expected card, keep playing the next prompt. If you run out before finding the card, play your finesse position. If you give a finesse that looks like a prompt, make sure the prompted card(s) is/are playable too.

### [15 - The Bluff](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/15%20-%20The%20Bluff.md)
* You can pretend to finesse a card that you don't see to get the player directly on your left to blind play his newest card, even if it is an unrelated card.

### [16 - Finesse or Bluff?](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/16%20-%20Finesse%20Or%20Bluff.md)
* If something that happens fit all the requirements to be a valid bluff, then it is assumed to be one, if not, then it is a finesse

### [17 - Urgency Principle](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/17%20-%20Urgency%20Principle.md)
* If you have something to blind play this turn, it is extremely important that you do it. Unless you see something else to do that HAS to be done now, your blind play are the most important action and should not be delayed.

### [18 - Early Game Part 2](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/18%20-%20Early%20Game%202.md)
* Only end the early game if there are no play clues and save clues left to give (or you run out of clues), and at least one stall has been given

### [19 - Priority](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/19%20-%20Priority.md)
* If you can play multiple things, order is Blind play -> Cards that allow someone else to play -> Cards that allow you to play -> 5s -> Lowest ranked card -> Most recent card.

### [20 - Priority Plays](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/20%20-%20Priority%20Plays.md)
* If someone seems to deviate from priority, it is signal, like a play clue, on the card(s) needed for the move to be correct priority. Any card you don't see, you have.

### [21 - Layers](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/21%20-%20Layers.md)
* If you promise a playable card to someone, you are not promising its exact position. You are only promising that, if they play the most likely card over and over, they will find it before making a mistake. They may play one or even many unrelated playable cards while looking for it, as long as they try the most likely (for a finesse, newest unclued card that existed when the clue was given) every time.

### [22 - 5 Chop Move](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/22%20-%205%20Chop%20Move.md)
* If you receive "5" on a card exactly one slot away from chop, it is a save clue on both the 5 and the current chop.

### [23 - Trash Chop Move](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/23%20-%20Trash%20Chop%20Move.md)
* If someone clues one or many cards that are obviously trash (and not on chop) and not a single useful card in a clue, they want you to discard those before your other cards. Chop move every card older than the oldest trash that got touched

### [24 - Scream Discard Chop Move](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/24%20-%20Scream%20Discard%20Chop%20Move.md)
* If the player on your left is about to discard a critical card and you can't save it, but he expects you to play something, discard instead to let him know he needs to use a clue right now.

### [25 - Gentleman's Discard](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/25%20-%20Gentleman%20Discard.md)
* If you are about to play a card, but see it playable (findable) somewhere else (ex: finesse position), you can discard it instead to send a message. Only do it if it brings some value.

### [26 - Balancing Plays](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/26%20-%20Balancing%20Plays.md)
* Try to spread cards to play around the table as much as possible. Having one person holding too many cards to be played can cost a lot of tempo

### [27 - Minimum Clue Value](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/27%20-%20Minimum%20Clue%20Value.md)
* Every clue should get at least one new card to be played now or later, except specific situations where you are forced to give a clue and nothing good is available

### [28 - Tempo Clue](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/28%20-%20Tempo%20Clue.md)
* When in a situation where no efficient value clues are available but you must say something, give a clue that gains tempo.
