Hanabi Technique of the day #1: The Chop

This is the start of Level 1: Beginner Strategies

TL;DR - Everyone draw new cards on the same side and discard first unclued card on the other side

At all points of the game, a player's oldest unclued card is called their chop. If they need to discard, they should always discard their chop.
The reason is that your oldest unclued card is the card most likely to be useless in your hand.
If you happen to have any criticial cards, other players can wait until they reach the chop to save them (and they might become playabale before then), instead of having to keep track of every entire hand for critical cards.

Exceptions:
-> A player has at least one clued card that is known to be useless (exemple: card clued as "1" and all 1s have been played already). This player has a chop, but there is no need to save critical cards on it, because they are expected to discard those cards before unknown cards.
-> A player has at least one clue on his entire hand (all cards touched and potentially still useful). This player has no chop, and must not discard. It is the responsibility of other players to leave him at least one clue to give or one card to play until the situation changes.

Hanabi Technique of the day #2: The good touch principle

Touching a card == giving a clue that includes a card 

When cluing cards, we should try, as much as possible, to touch only cards that will be played eventually, which we can call "useful cards".
Using this principle, we can deduce much information about our own hand from the clues we have (and have not) received.
Exemple: In this picture, Alice has received a clue (no matter how long ago) on a card, telling her that it is purple. Since there exists only one purple card that is useful at this point in the game, if Alice trusts that her teammates did only good touchs, she can expect that purple card to be the 5, and play it. 



This should be taken into account when choosing if you tell someone the number or the color of the card you want them to play. If either way violates the good touch principle, you should choose the other one.
If both ways respect the good touch principle, and you know that both will lead to the result you want (the person won't misunderstand the clue), then you should choose the way that gives the most "extra" information (touching cards that will be played eventually) in addition to the one you want.

Exceptions:
1: You are allowed to touch, as an extra, known trash cards, if and only if the fact that they are trash will be immediatly obvious to the person., and they cannot mistake them for useful cards. Ex: cluing many 1s when there is only one remaining to be played. As soon as it is played, the person who played it knows the others are trash, and will not mistake them. Exemple 2: Cluing green cards with the green 5, so when the 5 is played, all other become useless and the person knows it.

2: You can touch two copies of the same card in one hand at the same time, if you believe that it is critical that this card be played as soon as possible and you have no way to get it played otherwise. This will lead to a "mistake" precisely one turn later, so the team has one turn to "fix it" after the first copy is played, by spending another clue, therefore you should only do this if you have plenty of clues.

Hanabi Technique of the day #3: The Focus

TL;DR - One card is important now per clue. It is either the chop, or the most recent one if chop wasn't touched, within the newly touched cards

We should only give out clues when there is a reason for that clue. This directly brings the concept that, for a clue, there is one card that is the focus.
Following from Good Touch Principle, all the cards touched must be useful later, but there is no point giving a clue for something that won't be useful until 3+ turns. The focused card is the reason why we decided to give this clue right now, so it should give out information that is important right now.
Since none of the players choose the order that the other players draw cards, and can't reorder them, we have to rely on probabilities to hope that the focus is the card we want it to be.
First of all, only newly touched cards are taken into account when looking for the focus, you can disregard any card that already had a clue on it. You just received extra information for those cards, not implying anything else. If only already-touched cards are clued, then act like they are all newly touched.
At all points of the game, you are more likely to have important cards on your newest spot, because they could have been clued earlier if you had drawn them earlier. So when a clue touches multiple cards, the focus is the newest one, simply because that's what you will need to focus more often.
The exception is the chop. If the chop is one of the clued cards, it takes priority and becomes the focus of the clue. This is because, if it comes down to a bad scenario where you can't clue the card you want to focus correctly, you can always wait until it reaches the chop and get to focus it then, before it is lost.

Assuming that Bob draws on the right side, this "blue" clue here is a focus on the 1 (newer), and he now knows that the other card is a blue that will be important later, but can't guess if it is a 2, 3, 4 or 5. He will play it when he receives more information, or when only the 5 is left to be played.



Here, Bob should assume that his chop (right-most) is the next purple card to be played, and play it, while keeping the other two for later. Even if only the 4 and 5 are left afterwards, he should not try to guess which is which, he will need more information.

Hanabi Technique of the day #4: Critical cards and Save Clues

TL;DR - You should prevent discarding the last copy of a card. Clues touching chop that could be such a card are "save for later", not "play now"

A Critical card is a card that we cannot afford to discard or misplay, because our max score would be reduced. This is the case for all of the 5s at all points of the game, since they are all unique, therefore losing one means we can't complete that pile anymore. This is also the case for any other card that had the other copies discarded, therefore being now unique like 5s are.

Most clues in hanabi are Play clues, which are clues given in order to get one or several cards played. Sometimes, a clue is, instead, a save clue. Save clues are used to prevent a player from discarding a critical card. It is of paramount importance that save clues are understood as such, because when they are mistaken for a play clue, not only do mistakes happen, but those mistakes often implicate the critical card, reducing the max score obtainable.

A save clue interpretation has priority over a play clue interpretation, if both are reasonably believable.

A save clue is a clue that is focusing the chop (because there is no reason to save a non-chop card, since it is not in danger). When you receive a clue where the focus is the chop, you must look at the discard pile. If the information from the clue makes it that it is possible that the card is critical (and unplayable), you should keep it in hand until you get more information.

Exemple: In this example, Bob receives the clue "yellow" on his chop, and there are two yellow critical cards that it can be, the 2 and the 4. Bob must imagine that this card is either 2 or 4, and not play it.


If it ever becomes impossible that it is a 4 for any reason (ex: he gets a 4 clue in his hand and the card is not touched, he sees someone else drawing the second 4, or he gets confirmation that his card is a 2), he should play the card. If the other 2 ever becomes visible (sombody else draws it), he should figure out that his card must be the 4, and play it when it becomes playable.

Hanabi Technique of the day #5: Delayed Play Clues

TL;DR - Wait to play a card until all potentially-required cards already clued are played first

When a clue is given and it is not a save clue, then it must be a play clue. This is because otherwise, it would be a useless clue, and we shouldn't give those.

A play clue means that the card that was the focus of the clue is playable right now. The others touched cards are playable now or later, following from good touch principle. A play clue only tells you to play the focus.

Sometimes, a card is playable, not right now, and not in the far future, but very soon. For example, the green 3 is playable, another player was clued the red 2, and he knows that it is the red two and is expected to play it very soon, and then you receive a play clue on a 3. Assuming you know it is not a save clue, you should know that it is playable, but maybe not right now. In this situation, you should wait until the red 2 is played, which is an event everybody knows will happen very soon, and then play. At this point, regardless of if the clue was a play clue or a delayed play clue, it will work.

If, at the moment you receive the play clue, it is 100% known that the card is not playable right now (ex: no twos have been played, and you get a play clue on a 3), then you know for sure that it is a delayed play clue.

Hanabi Technique of the day #6: Trusting your team

TL;DR - Assume your team mates are smart and don't make mistakes

In Hanabi, there is a large number of situations that, because you never have perfect information, can look like a mistake or a smart play. If the play seems more advanced than what you expected from the person who made it, it might be tempting to assume it is a mistake and move on, but this should never be done.

The road to mastering a strategy includes failed attempts at trying it out. If it is brushed off as a mistake, not only will it be very frustrating for the person (who believes he did it right), and may unmotivate him from trying it again, but it will also not let him learn why he did it wrong (if he did). Playing into it, on the other hand, will either give them confidence (if it worked), or show them precisely what they did wrong if it fails, because they see the outcome.

The most epic plays in hanabi are the things that you are very unlikely to get the chance to do, because of a lucky card sequence. Those are also the easiest to not believe when done with your own hand (that you can't see), but you do not want to make your teammates lose his chance at an great play just because you find it unlikely.

If a person has made an habit of making a mistake in a certain situation (ex: someone always misses save clues), it could become tempting to play while taking this expected mistake into account, but it shouldn't be done. Everyone will eventually get it right, but if the person stops getting the chance to get it right, they will not improve. Furthermore, if they do get it right, but the team assumes they didn't and waste an extra clue to "fix" it, the person will not be happy about it at all.

Same goes for criticising a team mate for mistakes. Be constructive, explain exactly why what they did was wrong, and keep expecting they are doing it right the next time. If trust snowballs and disappears, you will never win a game again.

tl;dr : Everyone will make mistakes, it may cost you a game, but don't let it cost you subsequent games.

Hanabi Technique of the day #7: Fix Clues

TL;DR - If you are 100% sure a misplay is about to happen, spend a clue to fix it. Complete the information of the relevant cards. If you get a clue that changes something you were sure to know, it is a fix, not a play clue.

Most of the plays that may look like a mistake should be interpreted as a good move first, and you must assume that your hand has whatever is needed for the play to not be a mistake (Trust your team).

Fix clues are clues that are used to fix an impending misplay that you are 100% sure will happen. It is a clue that touches at least one card that the owner thought he knew, by giving him enough information to figure out that he was wrong about it.

There is no focus on a fix clue. The receiver was sure that he knew something, and that clue told him that he was wrong, it doesn't matter what else is touched by the clue. If at least one card was literally "changed" in the mind of the receiver, it is a fix clue, and everything else is just extra info. 

Fix clues should still at least attempt to follow good touch principle, otherwise it will require another fix clue later.

A fix clue should only be given if at least one of those is true:
    1: The impending misplay will kill the game (the team is on their last life)
    2: The impending misplay will destroy a critical card
    3: The fix clue can be given in a manner to "good touch" at least one other useful card.

This is because a fix clue is spending a clue to save a life and a card. If the card is trash and the team is at 3 lives, it can be misplayed, because saving it just to make the person discard it is spending a clue to get a clue, which is not worth it. If good touch allows you to make the fix and touch a future important card, then it is also worth it, since it is value-equivalent to a 1-card play clue.

Fix clues should NEVER be given too early, so that the person was not "ready" to misplay yet (not enough information), because they will not interpret it as a fix clue, but as a play clue on either the misplay card, or the (imagined) focus of whatever else you touched.

Exemples of fix clue required situations:

1: Alice knew this was purple, and good touch garanteed it was the 5, so Bob tells her that it is a 3 to avoid the misplay.
Until the 4 was played, there was a chance somebody would draw the real purple 5 and remove the need for a fix clue, so Bob waited until the last minute to give it.



2: Alice had a clued 1, and good touch told her it was green, so Bob gives her blue to avoid the misplay, AND touches another blue (good touch) for later. Alice must not assume that the other blue is playable right now

Hanabi Technique of the day #8: Quick mathematical reminders

TL;DR - Discarding is a last resort, the group is allowed very few discards to be able to get max score.

Even with minimal communication errors, a game of Hanabi is easy to lose by running out of cards. There are 50 cards total, and half of them must be played to win, which means we are in fact allowed very few discards in order to complete the board before the deck runs out.

Playing and discarding both consume a card from the deck, bringing the end closer, therefore those moves can only be done a limited number (x) of times. Since you need to play 25 cards, your allowed discards are [x - 25 = y], and you are allowed a total of [y + 8 = z] clues to do so. All of these numbers depends on the number of players. Here is a short table:


In a game with 5 people, you are only allowed to discard a total of 10 cards during the entire game, and if you discard more, you lower your max score. This number is very low and may come as a surprise to some people.

This is why it is of paramount importance to not discard too often during one game, and if you have a better move available, in most cases, you should do that instead.

This is also why Hanabi is easier, at least on paper, with 3 players than with 5.

Hanabi Technique of the day #9: The early game

TL;DR - Before the first discard, give as many play and save clues as possible to delay discarding semi-critical cards. You can even save 5s not on chop!

As mentioned in the previous tip, in Hanabi we are allowed very few discards to be able to get the maximum score. This means that, when possible, we should delay discarding to do something better.

There are two types of discard. Trash discard, and semi-critical discards. A trash discard is when a player discards a card that has already been played, and had therefore no value whatsoever. A semi-critical discard is when you discard a card that could have been played later on, but at least it's not the last copy of that card.

As a game tends to progress, the likelyhood of making trash discards goes up (as more cards are played), and the likelyhood of making semi-critical discards goes down proportionally. In a perfect game, only trash discards would be made, because the players manage to play the first copy of each card that they encounter.

This is the main reason why discarding should always be delayed when possible. It is better to give low-value clues than to discard, but it is not better to give zero-value clues than to discard.

The early game is the game phase that happens before the very first discard. We start with 8 clues and a lot of new cards, and we have to play as many of those as possible (without making mistakes) before the first discard, so that our discards  start with the highest possible likelyhood of being trash discards.

There are several differences between how you should play in the early game vs the midgame, but only one will be mentioned today.

During the early game, you can give save clues of 5s that are not on the chop. This is called a 5 Stall, and should always be given by number, not color, so that it is easy to identify. We assume that in the vast majority of games, no 5 will become playable during the early game, so the 5 stall clues cannot be confused with 5 play clues.

This kind of clue works on the idea that you will need to save this 5 eventually, because any 5 that is drawn in the early game is more likely to reach the chop before becoming playable, and this way we save it pre-emptively, while delaying our first discards.

Of course, if you can give actual play clues or save clues on the chop, or play a card, you should prioritize doing that over 5 stalls.

Hanabi Technique of the day #10: The Prompt

TL;DR - Give a play clue to a higher-rank card to notice someone a card they are saving is now playable and is the in-between card. If you see a play clue on a non-playable card, check your clued cards to see if one fits in between.

If a clue is given that is neither a save clue or a fix clue, you can usually assume that it is a play clue. Sometimes, a play clue will be given on a card that is not actually playable right now. If somebody else has a clued card that could be the missing link (and only one person could be the missing link), you can actually give the play clue.

The person receiving it should wait at least one turn to play if they see a playable "potential missing link" already clued in sombody's hand, to see if they will play it. To everyone else, it is even easier, because they see the card that has been play clued, so they know for sure if it is playable or not.

The only person who sees the clued card as non-playable AND who doesn't see the missing link, must have it.


Example:

Bob has a clued red card (good touch principle: this is either a 3, a 4 or a 5). Alive tells Cathy "Red", and touches the red 4 as a play clue. Bob THen knows that his card is the missing red 3, and can play it.

As with most blind play moves, if you have multiple cards that could be the prompted card in your hand, you play the most recent. If you are giving the prompt, always prompt if and only if the prompted player can figure out which card to play, either because there is only one option, or because this is the most recent that fits the required criteria.

You can self-prompt a palyer with his own hand:

Clue the 4, no 4 is playable, he knows his 3 is playable and is the missing link. (Only if he doesn't see the missing link prompted in anyone else's hand)

A Prompt cannot be a lie!


Here, Bob has the red 3, but if it is not on the most recent clued 3, the move is still valid if the other 2 are blue and/or green, so that he can play them, see that they were insufficient (but playable), and go to the next card until he finds the red 3. It must not be a lie, because Bob will keep playing until he finds it or misplays

Hanabi Technique of the day #11: The Finesse

TL;DR - Same as Prompt, except none of the clued cards fit the bill. Then play your newest unclued card. Give out finesses to get new unclued cards played for free.

The finesse is a play that is very similar to the Prompt. The main difference is that it is useful much more often, because you don't need the finessed card to be clued.

The finesse slot is defined as a player's most recent unclued card. If a play clue is given to a card that is unplayable right now, following from Trust your Teammates, you can assume that the missing card is in somebody's hand. The only person who doesn't see the missing card anywhere must have it.

If this person has no clued card that could be the missing card, then it is not a prompt, but a finesse, and they should play the card on their finesse slot.

In the following Example, after Alice points the Cathy's red 4 by saying "red", Bob knows he has the red 3, and it is on his finesse slot.



It is important to play finessed card as soon as possible, even if you have a good clue to give. The reason is that as long as you have not played it, there is an information desync. The finessed players know he should play, but the clued player also thinks that he should play because he doesn't see his own card. The finessed player should play on the very next turn to avoid the desync lasting more than one game turn, and make the clued player understand what is going on.

The finesse slot can move around like the chop, since it is the most recent unclued slot. For example, assuming the most recent card is on the left here:


This finesse actually points to Cathy's third card, since the first two are known as reds and can't be prompted.

Prompts take priority over finesses!

    Hanabi Technique of the day #12: Starting 1s

TL;DR - When playing 1s and having a choice, priorise freshly drawn 1s, then the 1s in oldest slots (not actually older, because all drawn at the beginning at the same time)



	
	
This move is a convention. It is not possible to logically figure out this move from first principles only, and should therefore only be used when the relevant players already know about it.
	


Usually, when you receive a clue for multiple cards, Good Touch principle tells you that they are all useful now or later, and in addition to that, if it is a play clue, the focus is playable right now. If any of the cards is actually a duplicate, it should become trivially obvious quickly (the last required card of that type is played on that turn, for example).

[Freshly drawn = a card that was not in your starting hand, and that has been drawn at any point later on]

If you receive a clue for multiple 1s, Good Touch Principle + trivial reasoning should tell you that they are all playable right now. If all the 1s are played before you are done playing all of yours, then the rest are trash cards.

1s are a special case, because they are the only card that is playable from the start. This means that, at the very beginning of the game, someone is likely to receive a multiple-1 clue in their starting hand.

When you have multiple 1s to play, the priority order goes like this:
    1: Any freshly drawn 1s, following clue focus principles
    2: "Oldest" 1 from the ones that were in your starting hand (it is not actually oldest, because it's your starting hand, but you take the one on the "old" side of your hand first.

Assuming the chop is on the right side on the screenshots, examples:


Then immediatly after playing the first one, Bob receives another 1-clue:



This principle is fairly easy to use, but kind of long to justify, so I'm not going to bore everyone with the explanation. If you want to know why, come see me and I'll be glad to explain the math.

Hanabi Technique of the day #13: The Reverse Finesse (and reverse Prompt)

TL;DR - If you receive a play clue, look in everyone's hand, see if it could be finesse or prompt. If it could, delay playing one turn to see if the person plays it. Play on the next turn, no matter if they played in-between or not

When you do a finesse or a prompt, you tell person B about a card in their hand that is playable, but that card is not actually playable right now. You do this if the missing card can be played before the person's turn, by person A who will realise they need to do so because everyone knows that card is somewhere, and only person A doesn't see it anywhere. Then, when comes B's turn, they can play the card they were clued, because it is now playable.

The reverse version of this move is pretty much the same thing, except whoever needs to play for the clue to work will get that chance AFTER person B has had a turn.

Of course, if person B just plays their card, it is a mistake because the card is not playable. When B's turn comes, they have to look around the table. They know one information about their card (rank or color), and they know that it is either playable right now OR very soon. They must look for any cards, either on the finesse position or clued (for prompts) around the table that could, if played right now, make their clued card playable. If they find one or several such cards, they must delay playing their card for one turn. If nobody plays one of the "missing" cards, then they can play their clued card, but if somebody plays one, then they are glad they waited.

Exception: If nobody plays any of the playable finessed/prompted cards, or nobody has any such cards, but you know for sure that your card is not playable, yet you also know that the clue was a play clue (example: play clue on a 3, but there are no 2s on the table, and nobody responds to the finesse/prompt), only one possibility remains. You have the missing card, and should play it, either from a clued card (prompt, priority interpretation) or your finesse position. Then on the next turn, you play the clued card.

Hanabi Technique of the day #14: The Prompt + Finesse

TL;DR - You get prompted, play it, it works, but was not the expected card. Keep playing as if it was a finesse. If you give a finesse that could be a prompt, make sure the fake prompted card is also playable. Always assume prompt over finesse if both are possible.

When you clue something that can be interpreted as a prompt or a finesse, the other players should interpret it as a prompt. This means that the only player who doesn't see the required card will play the clued cards that could be it in his hand.

But if they play that clued card, and it works, but it happens to not be the card that they needed it to be, then they still know that they have the correct card (you cannot lie on a prompt. You promise them they have the card, and they have to find it). They will then continue playing the clued cards that could be it until there are none. Afterwards, they will play they finesse position.

This means that if you take the opportunity, if somebody has a playable card on their finesse, you can get it played (and the card next after it) by cluing the next card to somebody else, and if you make your clue correctly, you may also get them to play one or many clued cards that are playable right now, even though they are in another suit.

Warning: If you can choose your clue to prompt some cards in addition to the finesse, that means you can also acidentally prompt some unplayable cards if you don't pay attention to how you do your finesse

Hanabi Technique of the day #15: The Bluff

TL;DR - You can finesse a non-existent card to get the player right after you to play his newest card, thinking it's the finessed card. If it's not, they realise you lied and everything stops. Only lie to the person playing right after yourself.

Finesses are quite efficient, getting many cards played from only one clue.

Whenever you see that a player has just picked up a playable card, you should look around to see if you can finesse it using a higher-ranked card of the same color.
Often, you will not be able to do so. But in that case, you can attempt to do a bluff.
If you find a card that is exactly one rank higher than a playable card of its color (so it is an unplayable card), and you clue it, then the person holding the actual playable card (different color, totally unrelated) will think he is being finessed, and play it. That is called a bluff.

Bluffs are quite dangerous because you lie to somebody by promising them they have a certain card, even if it is false. Therefore it is very important to only bluff when all the following criteria is met:

1: The clue is distinct from the bluffed card, so that the person who receives the clue can know that it was a bluff after the blind play, and not think that he has the next card of that color instead. Don't clue "3" on a red 3 to bluff a blue 2, because the receiver will think he has the blue 3 and misplay. Clue "red" instead

2: The clued card is exactly one-away from a playable card. If it is further, more people will attempt to play into the bluff thinking it's a finesse

3: You are bluffing the player that plays right after yourself (on your left), by cluing a card in another player's hand. When you bluff, everyone "doesn't see" the required card anywhere (since it's nowhere), so everyone assumes they are being finessed. Therefore, the first person who will get a chance to play will attempt to play the required card, so this person must be the target of the bluff. Everyone else should understand that it was a bluff when they see that person blind playing a card unrelated to the clue.

Hanabi Technique of the day #16: Is it a finesse, or a bluff?

TL;DR - If you blind played once and it was not the expected card. If the clue was given by the person right before you, it's a bluff, they lied to you, get over it. If it was given by anyone else, they weren't allowed to lie, it's a finesse, keep playing cards until you find the required one.

When a bluff happens, the person who was bluffed may believe that it was a finesse, and continue playing. Technically, nothing is garanteeing them that their next blind playable card is not actually the correct one.

Obviously, if they do continue playing, then we can never do a bluff anymore, because they will all result in a misplay.

If you just blind played a card, and it was playable, but not the expected one, you should assume that, if finesse and bluff are both possible, it is a bluff.


Since, in the bluff guidelines, the only person you are allowed to lie to is the person playing right after you, it logically follows that the only person who could be bluffing you is the one right before you. If they are the one who made the unclear move, assume it is a bluff. If it is anyone else, assume it is a finesse. If everyone understands this line of logic, then when you need to get finessed, somebody else than the person before you will do it, and when you need to get bluffed, that person will do it.


Do not attempt a layered finesse on the person right next to you, let somebody else do it, because they will understand it as a bluff.

As always, trust your team mates

Hanabi Technique of the day #17: The Urgency Principle

TL;DR - If you have something to blind play this turn, do it. At least one person is relying on you playing or not to understand the situation, if you don't play, they misunderstand and someone will misplay something.

As a response to some clues, some players will have to play an unclued card from their hand (called a blind play). Most of the times, when a player is blind playing, there is at least one other person who doesn't know that they will blind play, but knows that they may do it. For example, in a finesse, the clued player isn't sure if it is a finesse or a play clue until the finessed player does his blind play. He will only know after that player had a chance to play. If they blind play, it's a finesse, otherwise it's a play clue.

When you see a situation where you must blind play something, it is crucial that you do it as soon as you get the chance, because someone else's understanding of the events depends on it, and if you delay it, someone is likely to misplay, thinking they have the needed card too, or the clued player will misplay, thinking he has a playable card.

This means that on most occasions, you have to do it on your very next turn.

Exceptions:
    - You get the chance to do a good finesse/bluff, and nobody else can do it
    - You have to do something critical (saving a 5, for example), and either no one else can do it, or you have to help whoever will do it (ex: discarding to create a clue for them)

If you are the clued player, waiting to see if somebody blind plays, and the person who could have blind played does one of the things above, you should delay your own decision until they get one more chance to blind play, because if they did one of the moves described as an exception, they didn't truly get a chance to blind play yet.

Hanabi Technique of the day #18: Early Game 2

TL;DR - Only end the early game if you have nothing you can do and no clue you can give, except you can decide to not save an off-chop 5 if another 5 has already been saved previously.

Reminder: The early game is the period of time before the first discard

The players should try to extend the early game as much as possible. This includes "extinguishing" every play clue and save clue on the board before the first discard. Extinguishing: giving a clue to someone that takes care of it.

The goal is that when the early-game ends, discards are perfectly safe, because every player has an almost complete hand where every important card is already clued. Bonus: The piles are as high as possible already, to reduce the number of critical cards in the mid-game.

Exceptions:
    - Misplaying a card does not count as ending the early game
    - Discarding a known trash does not count as ending the early game
    - Doing a special discard move to give information does not count as ending the early game

5 stalls: You can end the early game even if there are 5 stalls remaining that could be given, as long as at least one has been given. This is because 5 stalls lose in value very quickly the more have already been given. You can still give them if you prefer that.

Extinguishing every clue does not include the player that played right before you. If this is the only thing you can do, that means that this person specifically did not see anything for you to do, and is expecting you to discard and end the early game. If they let you, that means your chop is safe (or they'd have saved it), so you can choose to end the early game instead of giving them something to do. Both options are fine.

Hanabi Technique of the day #19: Priority of play

TL;DR - If you can play multiple things, order is Blind play -> cards someone else needs -> cards you need -> 5s -> lowest ranked card -> most recently clued card.

Sometimes, your turn will come and you will have several playable cards. As mentioned earlier, blind plays should be played asap, but sometimes all of the cards are not blind plays. You should not choose randomly.

Here is the play order:
1 - Blind plays - Necessary to make sure everyone understands what the clue was
2 - Cards you are certain will allow someone to play the next of the pile - Not playing those makes the team lose Tempo
3 - Cards you are certain will allow you to play something on the next turn.
4 - 5s - The team will get a free clue!
5 - The lowest-ranked card - Lower piles are more important to play on. It is better to reach the endgame with 1 card missing from 3 piles, than 3 cards from 1 pile.
6 - The most recently clued card - Since you had another card playable, people could have left you alone, yet they gave you an extra play clue. It is likely that they want you to play that one first, or they could have waited.

Any tie should result in you playing the most recent card (recently drawn, not recently clued) first.

If a player does not follow priority of play, maybe they are trying to send a message with their choice (wink) Trust your team mates

Hanabi Technique of the day #20: Priority Finesse and Priority Bluff

TL;DR - If someone doesn't seem to follow priority, it means they see something you don't, aka something in your hand. You can assume they saw it and play your prompt (or finesse if no prompt) because of it. Always follow priority unless you want someone to blind play, because they will

Considering the priority of play tip from last time, you can take it to the next level.

If you, as a player, have two playable cards (let's say red 3 and blue 1). Priority would make you play the blue 1, and everyone knows that. But the red 4 and 5s are clued somewhere (red4 as 4, and red5 as red), but both as save clues and are not expected to get played for now. You could decide to play the red 3, to tell everyone "I see the 4). The player who doesn't see the red 4 anywhere knows that his clued 4 has been prompted, because the player who had a red clued would think it is it otherwise. They both get to play without receiving any extra clues.

Same scenario, but red 4 is not clued by anything yet (untouched), because it has just been drawn. The person with red5 still knows it is red. You could still play the red 3. To the red 5, this would look like a priority prompt, but everyone else sees they don't have the 4. One person doesn't see the 4 anywhere, blind plays their finesse position, then the other person has the last red card so plays it. Again, both play without receiving an extra clue.

Keep in mind that if you play the blue1 first, then playing the red3 will not tell anyone anything, it's just a play clue. Only when you blatantly disregard priority of play, can it be interpreted as a play clue on the cards that would be needed to make this work with priority of play

Also, in the same line of thought, you can Priority Bluff the person that plays directly after you.

Warning: You have to be sure, when you do a priority move, that your other playable card was not needed for the second one. Otherwise you misplay, lose a card, and don't give the info you wanted to give.
Ex: You have an unknown 3 and an unknown 4, both play clued, they could be the same color, and the 4 was actually a delayed play clue.

Hanabi Technique of the day #21: Layered Finesses

TL;DR - When you finesse someone not playing right after you, you promise them they have a specific card and can blind play it. If it's not the newest card, make sure every newer card they will attempt to blind play before the correct one is also playable. If you get promised something, keep playing until you find it.

Finesses, bluffs and prompts are part of a category of moves called promises. When you execute one of those moves, you promise the table that the missing cards are somewhere (In the case of the bluff, you lie about it, but you promised it nonetheless). Then, everybody is able to instantly confirm that (they see the card), except one person (the one who has it). This person has to trust you about it. You promised them that a needed card was in their hand, and you promised them that, if they play in the correct order, they will find it before misplaying.

Since everybody (except one) can literally see the promised card, your promise to them is over instantly. They don't need to blindly trust you, since they see it. The only promise that lasts is the one to the player who has it. Therefore, you can say that you only promise something to this person.

Promises that end up being lies, like the bluff, are only allowed to be performed on the player that is playing right after you. It is the only person you can lie to. In the same logic, the only person allowed to lie to you is the person playing right before you.

Therefore, if a player not allowed to lie to you promises you that you have a card, trust them.

This brings us to Layered Finesses. When you get promised a card, you are not promised its position. You are only promised that the position is findable without misplays. This means that, if you get promised a card, you may play one, two, or even three cards (playing your hand in order from potentially valid clued cards to newest blind cards to oldest blind cards) before actually finding the one you want. If you will end up playing unrelated cards before finding the correct one, then the person also promised you those unrelated cards will also be playable.

Example: SedNegi tells Zamiel about one 3 (the yellow3)




Zamiel is told he has a playable three. Of course, since no three is playable, he realises that the related 1 and 2 are also playable. Those two are promised. Dan sees that the 3 is yellow, and sees the yellow 1 in a playable position, he is promised a yellow two. Zamiel sees many cards as potentially playable, but there is no 1 playable right now to go with his three. He is promised a 1.

Dan waits, because he sees the y1
Zamiel plays purple1. Knows he is promised either the purple2 (and clue is purple3), or another 1
Negi does whatever
Dan does not play the yellow2, since the yellow1 is not played yet
Zamiel plays the yellow1. Knows he is promised either purple2, another 1, or nothing if dan plays yellow2
Negi does whatever
Dan plays yellow2, since he was promised it.
Zamiel knows he either has yellow3, purple2-3, green2-3 or rainbow2-3. He waits a turn to confirm
Negi does whatever
Dan does not play rainbow1. He is not promised anything anymore, since the 3 is now playable
Zamiel sees nothing has been played, understands nobody else is promised anything, his 3 is now playable. He plays yellow3
The clue is over.

Exercise for the reader:
If, instead of negi, Dan was the one to give a clue on the screenshot, what clue should he have given?
Do you see other great clues that any of the 3 players (or a fourth, unseen player) could have given, if they were to be giving one during the turn visible on the screenshot?

Hanabi Technique of the day #22: The 5 Chop Move

TL;DR - If you get clued a 5 exactly 1 slot away from your chop, assume it is a save clue AND a save clue on your current chop. As if an invsible clue touched your chop to save it, your new chop is now whatever comes right after the 5.



	
	
This move is a convention. It is not possible to logically figure out this move from first principles only, and should therefore only be used when the relevant players already know about it.
	
	
	
This move is part of the chop move category
	


Sometimes, the team will have been clue starved for a while, or just didn't pay attention enough. Your turn comes, and you realize that the player next to you has a critical card on their chop, and on the slot next to the chop

To make things worse, for the sake of explanation, let's say they will have nothing to do but discard on their turn. If you save either cards, the other will be lost.

It is now time to make a chop move!

A chop move is a category of moves (like finesses, etc) that allow you to save a card without cluing it. It is to be used as a last resort, especially in beginner games, because the saved cards will not be touched by anything, therefore it is very easy for the receiver to forget they are saved even if they do understand the save when it happens. Since the card will still be on the older side of the hand, if they forget the chop move, suddenly the untouched card becomes a chop again in their eyes.

Also, try not to forget about chop moves you receive. (smile)

The type of chop moved detailled today is the 5-chop move. Once you leave the early game, a clue on a 5 on chop is a save clue, but if it is anywhere else it is a play clue (except double-discard positions, then it is a stall).

The exception to that is, if the 5 was one card away from chop exactly (second oldest unclued card), and the clue specifically says "5", not the color, then it is a 5 chop move. It not only should be considered a save clue on the 5, but also a save clue on the current chop, even though nothing has touched it. The player should then act as if he received a clue with no information on that card, following good touch principle, it is a useful card (later), and never discard it.

Imagine we are playing in 6 color variant, and you receive a clue saying "this card specifically is not orange" on your chop. It doesn't tell you anything about its identity, but you can assume it's saved for later, not trash.

Hanabi Technique of the day #23: The Trash Chop Move

TL;DR - If you get clued cards that are 100% trash (and only such cards), assume everything older than them has just been saved, and don't discard those. You were given safe discards to avoid you discarding those.



	
This move is part of the chop move category


Another type of chop move is the trash chop move.

At some point in the game, provided the players are progressing, some card types become literally useless, aka known trash. Usually, 1s become known trash before anything else.

Giving someone a clue telling him about trash cards so that he may discard them is generally viewed as a waste of clues and a waste of tempo. Following normal play rythm, those cards would be discarded eventually anyway, as they reach the chop. Therefore, when somebody gives out a clue that points only to known trash cards (ex: cluing 1s after all 1s are played), it has another meaning.

Since you are telling the person about discardable cards, it is not because you want them to discard them (they would have done that anyway). It is because you want them to discard them first. Aka, you want to save their current chop.

But if you have a clue available and want to save their chop, you could just do a save clue on their chop, and they would understand it as a save . Therefore the reason for doing that is if you want to save multiple cards that are older than the trash you touch

So when you receive a clue touching one or many trash cards, and no non-trash cards, it should be understood as a trash chop move, which means "Save everything that is older than the oldest trash touched by the clue".

Assuming slot #5 is your chop, if you get clued "1" on slot #2, you should understand that as a save clue on slots #3, #4 and #5. You have no information on those cards, but you act as if they were touched by a zero-information clue, and you don't discard them. Good touch principle also garantees you they will all be played at some point.

Important: Chop moves are the first techniques explained here that are conventions, not logical strategies. A logical strategy is a concept that any group of players starting from scratch with no extra information will eventually realise, because it derives entirely logically from the rules of the game. A convention is something that helps players win, but that some groups may "create" in a different way than other groups, and may win just as much. Some conventions may be mutually exclusive, which means if you adopt one from a group, you may be unable to also adopt a specific other because they rely on the same information in a different way.

Example: Having a chop is a logical strategy (name can vary, of course), because it is logical to figure out a way to make future discards predictable. On the other hand, choosing to have your chop on the left side would be a convention. The game would work just as well by having the chop on the right and drawing cards on the left. It is important that a group agree to use the same side, but which side it is does not matter.

Hanabi Technique of the day #24: The Scream Discard Chop Move

TL;DR - If you can't save the next player's cards because you don't have clues, and have playable cards, discard to let them know things are really bad and generate a clue that they have to use on this turn. Don't do this if they can play something.



	
This move is part of the chop move category


The two chop moves explained earlier are ways to save multiple unrelated cards with one clue. However, sometimes you don't even have a clue at all.

Typically, discarding should be a last resort. If you have a playable card in your hand (and you know it), you are not expected to discard. If you end up discarding anyway, this sens a message to your team mates. This is like screaming at them that something is very bad.

Typically, the player being screamed at plays right after you. When you perform a scream discard, this player should consider his chop as a saved card, and not discard it.

Furthermore, you just made the effort of generating a clue for them because you really didn't want them to discard. This player should not discard anything on this specific turn, just in case you wanted to save more than one card. You then have one more turn around the table to do something about the extra cards, if there are any. If nothing is done, then they become safe to discard again on the next turn. Only the chop remains saved forever, because the scream discard was done to save at least one card.

Exceptions:
    - If the player discarding needed to generate clues for something unrelated but obvious to the next player, it is not a scream discard
    - If the next player had playable cards and was not expected to discard anyway, it is not a scream discard 
    - If the only playable card that was "ignored" for the discard to take place was a blind play (ex: finesse), this only means that the player also saw the blind playable card in somebody else's hand, and did not consider having something to play at all.

Hanabi Technique of the day #25: The Gentleman's discard

TL;DR - If you see the card you are about to play on somebody else's finesse position, discard instead to get a free clue and they will understand that they can play it.

Most of the time, if you know that you have a playable card, then you have a pretty good idea of what it is. If you are about to play a card that was clued with the color, you should know exactly which card it is (only one card of that color is playable), and if the early game is over, it is likely that only a few cards with the number you were given are playable, etc etc.

If you know exactly which card it is you are about to play, then you should look around the table for something better to do. If you were to discard this card that everybody knows you know about, you are telling everybody that you see another copy somewhere, and that this copy will be playable as soon as yours would have been playable, which can be right now.

As always, everyone sees the card too, except the person who has it, so they know they have it and that it is findable, so they start playing until they find it. If your copy wasn't playable yet, then they will note what was their finesse when the discard happened, and start playing later when your copy would have been playable.

Basically, you are being a gentleman by letting them play instead of yourself.

This is a move that is powerful. You are discarding a future known trash card, so you get a clue for free instead of by discarding a risky, possibly semi-critical, chop. Furthermore, you might get more than your card played, if the other person has it hidden behind other playable cards.

On the other hand, this can lose tempo. You are delaying a play after all. The gentleman's discard should only be performed if at least one of these is true:

1: The tempo loss from the delay is zero. For example, the other person has nothing better to do and would have discarded anyway, the next card of that suit had no chance of being played before the person's turn, etc. In this case, it's a free play clue and a free trash discard, no strings attached

2: The tempo loss from the delay is lesser than the value gain from the discard. For example, it is usually acceptable to lose a turn of tempo if you get two cards or more played from it, assuming you are not at tempo limit.

3: The tempo loss from the delay is compensated by a tempo gain that is equivalent or bigger. For example, if getting that new clue earlier means something else can be done with it to gain tempo, or if the other playable cards played in the layered gentleman's discard actually gains the team a turn of tempo because the next one of that suit is available.

4: The tempo loss from the delay is irrelevant, because the move somehow saves the game. Maybe the player next to you needed a clue to save a critical card, or maybe the player you are gentlemanning was about to discard a critical card, etc.

Reminder: gentleman's discard, like most other moves, should be prompting the copy of the card before finessing it, which can be used in the layering.

    If you go a level higher, if you receive a gentleman's discard that looks like it just lost tempo, you can assume it either saved the game, gained value or gained tempo in a way that you can't see (so related to your hand). In some cases, this might tell you something important (wink)

Hanabi Technique of the day #26: Balancing Plays

TL;DR - When possible, try to spread future plays among the players as much as possible. When one player has too many things to play, it cost a lot of tempo

Most of the previous techniques were either ways to get cards played or saved with few or no clues at all, because clues are a limited resource.

If you understand all the previous Techniques relatively well, you will win some games, but not all games, even though your clue efficiency will usually be higher than the minimum required. This is because of Tempo.

Pretty much every deck shuffle is winnable, but some decks are much easier than others when it comes to Tempo. To reach the next level, you must optimize your tempo.

One of the biggest things, when it comes to tempo, is the fact that one player having more cards to play than the others is bad. For each card a player needs to play, every other player needs to do something too, because you can't skip turns. The game's entropy menas that you move closer to the end faster than you are progressing. For example, if only one player has playable cards, then for each card played, n-1 (n being the number of players) clues or cards are used up (discards).

Of course, if a playable card is only visible in that player's hand, it would be a worse waste of time to not do anything about it than to clue it. But for all the cases where you see two copies, you should prioritize getting the one that is in a less-active player's hand.

By less active, I mean that he has one of the following, in order from most important criteria to least
1: fewer clued playable cards
2: fewer unclued playable cards (excluding the one you are about to maybe clue)
3: fewer clued unplayable (saved) cards
4: fewer unclued unplayable (but maybe playable later) cards
5: unclued unplayable (but maybe playable later) cards are closest to their chop

Sometimes you will need to choose between a more clue-efficient play (ex: finesse) or a more tempo efficient play (getting the card in a less active player's hand). There is no general correct answer to that.

Each specific case must be evaluated to the best of your capacity. How efficient is the clue-efficient play? (2 cards for one clue? 3? more?). How unbalanced will the hands be if you choose to prioritize clues (is it 4-0, or 3-2?)? Is your team currently in need of clues, or in need of tempo? Are therer many critical cards close to chops, do you need the extra clues to save them?

Hanabi Technique of the day #27: Minimum clue value principle

TL;DR - Normally, only give clues that get 1 or more new cards played or saved. Except in specific scenarios when you are forced to give a clue, then you can give a low value clue, or in the worst case, a zero-value clue

In Hanabi, clues are a resource that needs to be used wisely. In most games, we need an efficiency higher than 1 to win. Efficiency is defined as the number of cards that get played per clue, on average.

Therefore, we should always try to get the maximum value out of our clues. This is why all moves that get people to blind play are good. Clues that get 2 cards or more played (including "play later", like a Bluff) are good, while moves that get exactly one card played are mediocre.

Since tempo is also very important, we do give 1-value clue often, because waiting for a better chance that may not come any time soon is bad.

This is also why, if somebody picks up a new card that is playable, the first thing you should look for is a way to finesse it. If you can't, this doesn't mean it is impossible. It is possible that you currently hold a card that allows that.

So if the order of play goes A->B->C->D, D just picked up a playable card and you are A, you should check first if B or C have something better to do (like playing). If at least one of them is expected to give a clue or discard, and you would use a 1-value clue to get the new playable card played, you should let them clue the newly picked up card. They might get a chance to get better value by finessing it, or if it is C, they could also Bluff it, and you may already see what they can use to do so, in B's hand.

There are some cases where you are forced to give out a clue, or at least you really should give out a clue, no matter what it is. In those cases, low-value clues are accepted, and in the worst case scenario, zero-value clues can be given.

Of course, if you have something to play, you can just play. Those situations only apply if you have to choose between low-value clue or discarding.

Cases where low-value clues are accepted:
 - When the team is at 7 clues (if you discard, the next player might be forced into a zero-value clue)

 - When in the early game

Example of low value clues: Cluing something already saved to say that it is now playable, stalling by cluing a 5, giving someone the color of a clued 5, etc


Cases where zero-value clues are accepted (low-value are still better)

 - When the team is at 8 clues (can't discard)
 - When you are in double-discard situation
 - When your entire hand is clued
 - When you just received a Scream Discard
 - When in the endgame

Example of zero-value clues: Regiving a known information, stomping on a finesse, etc

Hanabi Technique of the day #28: Tempo Clues

TL;DR - When you are in a position where you can give a low-value clue, and you don't see any clue of 1+ value, give a clue that will gain Tempo for the team

A tempo clue is a clue that touches no new cards, or that the only new cards touched are obviously trash from the point of view of the clue receiver. Their purpose is to get one of the already clued card played earlier than it would have been, if the game had flowed normally.

For example, someone may have a clue 3 in their hand, whose color they don't know, and that happens to be playable right now. If the game flows normally, this person will play it when all the 2s are on the stacks (or earlier, if they get a prompt or something). A tempo clue would give them their 3's color, so that they play it now, gaining tempo.

Since the card would have been eventually played without any extra clue, the card-value of the clue is zero, but since we gain tempo, the clue has some tempo-value. It is then qualified as a low-value clue (not really, zero, but below 1). The exact value depends on the precise tempo gain. Are the next cards of this color playable? Are they already clued? Does this person has many clued cards, and does this help balance?, etc.

It is hard to put a precise number on the value of a tempo clue. We know that tempo is less valuable than cards, but as cards is a fixed value, tempo value is extremely situational. On the other hand, it is usually easy, comparing two tempo clues, to know which one has the higher value.

Note: When someone gives a clue, always be aware of their situation. If they were allowed to give a low-value clue, or a zero-value clue, take that into account in your interpretation.

Exceptions: You can also give tempo clues in those situations, even if you shouldn't give another low-value clue, because the tempo value is very high in those cases:
    - When the tempo clue gets two or more cards played  now, as opposed to waiting for them
    - When the card was out of order, and there was no way to prompt it later on anyway (it will eventually cost a clue regardless)
    - When the card was chop moved, because it can't be prompted so will cost a clue later regardless

Hanabi Technique of the day #29: Double Half bluffs

This is the start of Level 2: Intermediate Strategies

WARNING Do not attempt to do those, if you don't have a lot of experience with standard bluffs (both receiving and giving). If you have confidently given and responded to standard bluffs many times in the past, and have a very high success rate for those, then you can start looking at double bluffs.

TL;DR - You can bluff someone not directly on your left, if the bluff also finesses the card of everyone playing before it happens, in the correct order.

When describing the bluff, a special condition had to be true. You can only bluff the person who plays immediatly after yourself. The reason was explained: When bluffing, everyone thinks they have the required card, therefore your target must be the very first person who will get a chance to play it, since they would all attempt it. After this person plays, everyone understands that it was a bluff, blablabla.

In some specific conditions, you can do bluffs on someone who is not directly on your left, following the same logic.


Order of players: A->B->C->D->E

You are: A

B has a playable green 1 on his finesse position

C has a playable red 1 on his finesse position

D has the green three anywhere.


If you clue the green 3 with "green", as a play clue, everyone will immediatly see that B has the 1. But no one will see the 2 anywhere, so everyone will think they have the 2. B thinks it's on the second newest card, C, D and E think they have it on finesse.


B will play his 1, expecting to play the 2 later.

C will attempt to play the 2, but end up playing a red 1 instead. Everyone, seeing that he played, understand that the green 2 is nowhere to be found and that this was a double bluff. C could think it's a layered finesse and green 2 is on his next card, BUT, as explained in the bluff technique, he sees that it could be a bluff, because in this situation, he was the "very next" player to get to play the 2, therefore he must assume it is a double bluff. If it truly was a layered finesse, E could have given it instead to make it clear.


In most cases, you can only bluff the person directly on your left. But the actual rule is: bluff only the very first person who will try to act on the perceived (fake) finesse, which happens to be almost always the person on your left.

In the cases of double half bluffs, it is the player right after.


Logically, you can also do triple two-thirds bluffs, and so on, following the same logic. Only One of the played card is the "fake" one, everyone that plays before must play a real card on the pile leading to the clued card.

This does not include what to do with the clue (ex: if you receive a play, looking for finesses and stuff), just what type of clue it is, according to your known knowledge right now.

I didn't plan on making this, but I see many people have trouble catching save clues and such, so here it is. I hope it makes the relationship between all types of clues much clearer. Click for full-size


If people express interest, I may make similar charts for what to do when you get a play clue, what to do when someone else gets a play clue, How to choose what to play, How to choose what to discard, etc. If you want to see one of these flowcharts (or any other that I didn't think abut), ask, and I'll make one.

Hanabi Technique of the day #31: Positional Discards

TL;DR - If you know that your entire hand is trash, and you want to tell someone what to play, instead of using a clue you can just choose to discard the card on the position that you want this person to play.

Most of the time, our hand is incertain. You don't know all the cards, or even most of them. The whole point of having a chop is that you know which card is more likely to be trash (and can be saved if not).

But sometimes, in some very specific cases, you may know that your entire hand is trash cards. For example, near the end of the game, there will come a point where all the useful cards are drawn. If you have none of them, then you see all of them, so you can know you only have trash.

Usually, this will only happen during the endgame, but sometimes it may happen slightly earlier. Now two things can happen. Either the team has plenty of clues, and you can just do your best to win the endgame with those, or your team can have clue issues which means that either you have no clues, or you have few clues and you are aware that there is a risk you run out of them.

In the second case, you should start doing positional discards. Every time your turn comes, if you have enough tempo to afford it, you can discard instead of giving a clue. You choose a card that you want to clue, check what slot it's on (1-2-3-4-5, starting from newest), and discard the same slot in your own hand. This tells everyone "somebody can play the card on this specific slot". If there was only one person, then as always, the only one who doesn't see such a playable card knows they have it.

If there are several players with a playable card on this slot, it's slightly more complicated. First of all, eliminate those who already knew about the card, since the discard was intended as a useful message. Then, eliminate those who have something else to play this round, since the discard used up tempo, so must be giving someone something to do this round. Then, out of all the remaining potential target, you have to expect that the last one to get a turn will play. The first one will not, because they see the card, and the second one, seeing that the positional discard was ignored, should understand that there were multiple targets, and play.

This move is powerful, because it lets you clue something even when the team has zero clue, while gaining a new clue. Furthermore, during the last turn, tempo is irrelevant, so it can always be used.

This move is also dangerous. You are near the end of the game, you have no cards to play and never will, yet you consume tempo. Make sure you count correctly and are 100% certain that you drawing a card on this turn instead of using a clue will not screw over somebody. If you do have zero clues, then have fun, because you were drawing a card regardless.

The vast majority of positional discards will be done during the last turn around the table, because all cards are visible and discards are not risky at this point. It is possible to do them earlier, just be aware of the risks and pre-conditions.

Hanabi Technique of the day #32: Generation Discards

TL;DR - If player 3 has a critical card on chop, and there are no clues, player 1 can discard as if it was a scream discard, but only so that player 2 can save it.

Sometimes, You have a playable card (or many), yet you foresee a big problem coming. There are no clues, and the player two turns after yourself has a critical card on chop. If you play, the player next to you will have to save this card without a clue. They may be able to scream discard, but doing so will lose another critical card (or even a semi-critical), and you don't want that.

At this point, you can, instead of playing, discard your chop, exactly as if you were doing a Scream Discard. Since the next player can obviously see the critical card of the following player, he knows that this was a generation discard. You generated a clue so that he could save the card with a clue, instead of saving it with a discard. The following player may think it was a scream discard, but once they receive the save clue, they will understand.

Hanabi Technique of the day #33: Occam's Razor

TL;DR - When two interpretations are possible, once you have gone through every possiblity in an attempt to clear it up and still aren't sure, assume the safest explanation, and if all are equal, assume the simplest one.

This one is pretty easy, but I've seen it a few times.

If you receive a clue that could be many things, priority interpretation is the safest interpretation (ex: we assume save clue over play clue when possible). Otherwise, we try to give people the chance to disambiguate (ex: waiting one turn to see if someone blind plays, to see if the clue is a finesse or not).

If all else fails, and you still aren't sure, assume the simplest explanation is correct. For example, if you get clued a 3 and there are no 3s playable and no 2 on finesses, assume it's a self-finesse. If you get clued a 3 but there are 3s playable, don't assume it's a self-finesse, assume simple play clue.

Basically, don't overthink it.

Hanabi Technique of the day #34: Accomplice bluff

TL;DR - You can bluff someone that is two seats away from you, using a card in the player on your left's hand, if the clue could not possibly be misinterpreted, which means the player receiving will understand the bluff instantly and be your accomplice in it

Usually, you only bluff the player on your left, for the reasons mentioned in other HTotD.

One of the exceptions is if the person receiving the clue is both the "standard" target (on your left), and knows enough about their hand to understand the play instantly.

For example, if they have negative 1 on their chop (but no clues), and you tell them "yellow" on the chop only, which is a yellow 2, and the next playable yellow card is the 1, they are in a situation where they know for a fact that their chop is a non-1 yellow, and all the other cards are non-yellow. Therefore, they are sure that they do not have the yellow 1. There is zero risk of them playing that card as Yellow 1.

Normally, if they saw the yellow one anywhere, it would be a finesse, and they'd wait for it to play, to play their two. Now, if they don't see the 1 anywhere, they usually should think that either the clued card is the 1, or a two and it's a self-finesse, but now both cases are impossible. At this point, they can notice that the player on their left has a playable unrelated card on finesse position, and that you just forced them into being your bluff accomplice.

They will act as if they saw a yellow 1 somewhere, even if its not, which means they delay playing on the clue for one turn. Every other player thinks they have it, the first one to get a chance plays, which is the one two seats away form the clue giver, and they play an unexpected unrelated playable card. In this specific case, you also saved a 2 on chop, but the clued 2 could be anywhere, it just needs to have negative information sufficient to understand that it's not playable.

Hanabi Technique of the day #35: Trust level

TL;DR - Decide, when you start a game, what your trust level is for each team mate, and then act according to this level.

in HTofD #6, I said "Trust your teammates". While this may seem to make sense on the surface, it actually doesn't hold when you start playing with a group of people with wildly different experience levels.

There should always be, at least, minimal trust. Which means that, if your team mate makes a move that could either be correct or a mistake, depending on your hand, you should assume you have what is needed or the move to be good. the reasoning is explained in #6. Basically, if they do get it right, you have to act on it, and if they don't, it's going to be easier to see their own mistake if it causes a misplay, than if you act as if nothing happened.

That's minimal trust level.

For the higher trust levels, there isn't a pre-defined list of levels, because it is highly dependent on the group, how experienced the best players are, and how inexperienced the worst players are. Furthermore, it depends on the conventions used (irrelevant of strategies), the variant used, and if you are playing online or IRL.

Usually, the max trust level is assuming that every player is as good as the best one, and knows all of the same things as them. If you play with maximum trust, you can infer information not only from the moves made, but also from the moves not made. For example, you could guess that you don't have a specific card in your hand if, had you had it, a player could have done a finesse, yet they chose to do a weaker move. If you manage to act on this information, then another player could understand that they were finessable from it, and blind play, etc.

I can give a good example of a Trust Finesse that occured the other day with Brahim Hadriche and Owen, if anyone is interested.

Higher trust level needs to actually be correlated with expectations, because the higher the trust is, the more misplays will happen if a trusted person doesn't play as well as expected.

Trust level is on a player basis. You can have high trust for someone, and low trust for someone else. In the extreme case, you may be doing priority bluffs on a player, and not even attempt finesses on another.

Furthermore, you should usually give a player trust that is slightly higher than your actual expectations. This is because players will attempt to use new moves when they see the chance, and there is a first time for everything. When they attempt a move slightly above their own level, they should be trusted on it so that if they do it well, it works. This is literally the only way for them to improve.

If you don't trust them enough, they can't improve. But be careful, if you give them trust that is too high above their level, they will inadvertently cause misplays when they do acceptable but non-optimal moves and you "trust" that there is a deeper meaning. If you overestimate someone and misplay on their correct but not perfect moves, it's on you. As the more experienced player, it is your responsability to correctly assess the less experienced player's skill level and trust them appropriately. In many cases, this will be hard, and you may get it wrong. You definitely shouldn't blame an unexperienced player for playing lower than your trust level. You should have given them lower trust.

On the other hand, if you are the less experienced player, and you want higher trust to be able to make more impressive plays, then you have to convince your team that you are good enough (smile)

    Hanabi Technique of the day #36: Ambiguous Finesses

TL;DR - If two people have the card you want to finesse, and the second one has high trust for the first one, you can do your finesse. The fact that the first doesn't play should be enough to make the other understand what is going on.

Now that trust levels are introduced, here is the first move that explicitly depends on it.

If you ever see a team mate missing a finesse, and you have low trust in them, that's sad. But if you have high trust in them, specifically if you trust that they don't miss finesses, then you can extrapolate from the fact that they didn't play, that somebody else also has the finessed card on a playable slot. If you don't see it, you have it.

You should only ever give ambiguous finesses if you know that the second player who will get a chance to play has high finesse-trust in the first one, so that it works. If trust is too low, both players will not play, thinking the other is the target, and both will think that the other missed it.

The second player of an ambiguous finesse can be the one who gave the clue! It just happens that they didn't know it was ambiguous at the time. If such a case happens, the finessed player purposely decided to "pass" the finesse to the giver for a reason. Maybe they had something else to play, and this helps balance, or maybe the team is low on clue and this is the equivalent of a gentleman's discard, etc etc.

If you think that the targets's trust is too low for this to work, you should not give it. It can and will end up in a misplay when people start trying to fix it. I can explain why in more details if anyone is interested. In this specific case, just wait until one of the targets gives the finesse to the other one instead.

This move is one of the many that rely not only on trust levels, but also on the player's knowledge of each other's trust levels. Trust levels are neither taboo, secret, or insulting, they are necessary to be able to play efficiently. Don't take it personally if somebody has low trust in you, it's better that you know it, and if you ask them why, you have a chance to improve.

The previous HTotD didn't mention it, but Trust level are also move-dependent. For example, you can trust that somebody understands finesses very well, yet not trust that they understand bluffs. You trust the person's ability to do things, not the person itself.

    Hanabi Technique of the day #37: Double Discards

TL;DR - If somebody discards a semi-critical card, the player playing immediatly after them should not discard unless they see the other copy somewhere, because they may have it and nobody had time to save it.

There is not much to say that wasn't in the TL;DR.

If somebody discards a semi-critical, it is possible the other one is on the next person's chop, and nobody had time to save it. This person should not discard on this turn, unless they can see it somewhere, just in case.

When you are in "double discard position", which means you're not allowed to discard on this turn, you are allowed, if necessary, to give a low-value clue, or if absolutely necessary, a zero-value clue. It is obviously better to play or give a good clue.

Double Discard position was mentioned briefly in HTotD #27, because I thought I already explained what they are. Seems like I had not, so better late than never.

Double Discard position sucks for tempo and optimization of clues, but there is no real solution to that. The more skilled a group becomes, the fewer semi-critical discards will be done, therefore this situation will become rarer.
​[05/06 07:37] Alex Gilbert
    PS: If you see somebody discard even though they are in double discard situation, and you have reasonable trust, you can assume the other copy of the card is visible. As always, if you don't see it, you have it.

Furthermore, if they do discard, when in double discard situation, even though you know for a fact that there was a good value clue they could do, and there was no reason to discard (generation discard, scream discard, etc), this is a finesse double discard, where they tell the person who has the other copy that it is playable right now, therefore on newest card position (or on a clued card, if prompt is possible). Logically, you can do bluff double discards this way too.

Hanabi Technique of the day #38: The Trash Prompt/Finesse/Bluff

TL;DR - If someone has a card to save on chop, point one of their trash cards with a clue that makes them think it's playable, so that the person who has the actual playable card on finesse position plays. Most usages will be to get 5s played.

Usually, when you are near the endgame, several piles will be pretty high (3-4). At that point, if somebody picks up a playable card (ex: a 5), you may be tempted to clue it directly, because there are no cards of a higher rank to finesse it with.

Using the logic that, when you are expected to play, you play finesse position (or prompt if possible), you can also finesse high cards that have no higher-rank cards to clue.

B just picked up a yellow 5
C has a critical card on chop, and an unclued yellow 4 somewhere else (the other yellow 4 is already played)
A can clue "Yellow" to C.

From B's perspective, it looks like C will attempt to play a trash card as if it was yellow 5 on his turn. It looks like a mistake, but he trusts A to not give such horrible clues. This must mean that he can fix the impending misplay by playing the necessary card for C to figure out his card is trash. B then plays yellow 5.
C understands his yellow is trash, and since the only reason to tell him about a trash instead of cluing the 5 directly is to give him a known trash discard. He strongly suspects that his current chop is either critical or semi-critical.

You can use this move to do prompts, finesses, or even bluffs to the person on your left. The fact that the moves triggers a blind play should be enough for the third person to understant that his card is trash.

Hanabi Technique of the day #39: The 3 Bluff

TL;DR - It is possible to do a bluff using a 3 on most cards (except a 2, if the 3 that goes with it isn't touched or entirely visible yet)



	
	
This move is a convention. It is not possible to logically figure out this move from first principles only, and should therefore only be used when the relevant players already know about it.
	


Usually, when you do a bluff, you always use a card that is exactly one-away from playable, with an information that does not match the card that will get played. You'd say blue to bluff a red 1 for example.

This not only increases efficiency, because it's like a free finesse (2 cards for 1 clue), but also helps tempo a lot. Every time you make a bluff, you pre emptively save a card (often a 2, but any card is possible except 1), making sure you don't have to save it when it reaches the chop, but also the bluff conventions make sure that the owner knows exactly which card he has, or has a very good idea. (99% of the time, you can infer what card the bluffed player was trying to play from the information available and the clue). This means that in addition to never needing to save that card (save clues ruin tempo), you don't have to clue it again, it will get played naturally eventually.

When you reach that level of play, you have pretty good efficiency and tempo. Now your biggest problem will be a deck shuffle that contains a 3 near the bottom. You don't save the first copy you see, and then, depending on who gets the 4 and the 5, you may be unable to finish.

We could allow save clues on 3s, like we do for 2s, but this has been tested and the lost opportunity of being unable to play clue a 3 on chop is much more problematic than the added value.

Therefore, the 3 bluff has been created. By agreeing to allow "special" bluffs that are not one-away from playable, specifically on 3s, you can save a larger number of first-seen 3s in the early game by using them to bluff, which will improve drastically your chances of not getting bottom-decked by a sneaky 3.

Technically, nobody needed to hear the entire story of how 3-bluffs were created. But this context is important, to make sure players understand that if you can do both types of bluffs, you should choose the 3-bluff, because the added value of pre-emptively saving a non-critical 3 is very high.

TL;DR - It is possible to do a bluff using a 3 on most cards (except a 2, if the 3 that goes with it isn't touched or entirely visible yet)



	
	
This move is a convention. It is not possible to logically figure out this move from first principles only, and should therefore only be used when the relevant players already know about it.
	


Usually, when you do a bluff, you always use a card that is exactly one-away from playable, with an information that does not match the card that will get played. You'd say blue to bluff a red 1 for example.

This not only increases efficiency, because it's like a free finesse (2 cards for 1 clue), but also helps tempo a lot. Every time you make a bluff, you pre emptively save a card (often a 2, but any card is possible except 1), making sure you don't have to save it when it reaches the chop, but also the bluff conventions make sure that the owner knows exactly which card he has, or has a very good idea. (99% of the time, you can infer what card the bluffed player was trying to play from the information available and the clue). This means that in addition to never needing to save that card (save clues ruin tempo), you don't have to clue it again, it will get played naturally eventually.

When you reach that level of play, you have pretty good efficiency and tempo. Now your biggest problem will be a deck shuffle that contains a 3 near the bottom. You don't save the first copy you see, and then, depending on who gets the 4 and the 5, you may be unable to finish.

We could allow save clues on 3s, like we do for 2s, but this has been tested and the lost opportunity of being unable to play clue a 3 on chop is much more problematic than the added value.

Therefore, the 3 bluff has been created. By agreeing to allow "special" bluffs that are not one-away from playable, specifically on 3s, you can save a larger number of first-seen 3s in the early game by using them to bluff, which will improve drastically your chances of not getting bottom-decked by a sneaky 3.

Technically, nobody needed to hear the entire story of how 3-bluffs were created. But this context is important, to make sure players understand that if you can do both types of bluffs, you should choose the 3-bluff, because the added value of pre-emptively saving a non-critical 3 is very high.

Hanabi Technique of the day #40: The trash push

TL;DR - If you clue a known trash that is on somebody's chop, it means that they should play their oldest unclued card (their new chop after the trash clue). This is only true if the clue only touches trash cards, and it is obvious to the receiver that they are trash. If it's not obvious, it may be a trash finesse or trash bluff (#38), and if none are on chop, it's a trash chop move (#23)

As mentioned by Good Touch Principle (#2), trash cards should not be clued, if possible. Furthermore, a clue that only touches trash card would be a very bad clue, unless it has a special meaning.

As mentioned in #23, if you clue only known trash cards that are not on chop, it must be because you want them to be discarded, instead of the chop, therefore the chop must be saved right now. It is possible that not only the chop should be saved, but also the cards next to it. You should chop move all the cards older than the oldest trash touched, when receiving such a clue.

As mentioned in #38, if you clue trash cards that are not known as such, no matter where, you are finessing all the cards that could fit this clue that are remaining to play, in other people's hands. For example, a newly picked up 5. You can also bluff this way.

Now, sometimes, you want to clue a card that is not on chop right now. The draw was unlucky, and there is no clue that gets the focus you want, but it is extremely important to play that card asap, as opposed to waiting until it reaches the chop. You need this tempo.

In that case, you can clue the person's current chop. Then, after the clue, the card you want is the new chop, and another person can do a clue to get the card played. For this to work, the first clue needs to be obviously trash, otherwise there is a risk it will get played. 

Once you have given a clue that is obviously trash, and it's on chop, the receiver might wonder why you would give him a trash clue here. He can understand, by himself, that you were attempting to "move" their chop to a playable card, for tempo reasons, so that somebody else can clue it. this means that nobody actually needs to give the second clue.

Since the only explanation is that you wanted to move the chop to a playable card, the person knows without the second clue that their new chop is playable.

PS: You can also move their chop by giving a save clue or play clue on the current chop. But if it is not obviously trash, the person can't figure out by themselves that this was your intention (because we give those clues all the time without trying to move the chop), so in this case, somebody actually needs to spend the second clue. It's not inherently bad, but it's not the Trash Push technique, it's just 2 clues.

Hanabi Technique of the day #41: The Endgame

TL;DR - The endgame is extremely hard, but as soon as there are so few cards left that you can brute force it, do it. Then take mathematically-educated guesses

Hanabi Endgames are very hard to figure out. They are literally NP-complete. There is no known algorithm (yet?) that allow you to calculate the endgame, other than literally brute forcing the possibilities (or use an algorithm equivalent or worse than brute force).

It would be easy to refer to the endgame as the portion of the game that happens after the deck is empty, but that's not optimal. Endgame decisions start much before that, specifically in trying to optimize who will pick up the last cards.

Usually, the endgame is defined as the portion of the game where there are so few remaining cards, that players can brue force the ending and make mathematically supported decision and gambles depending on the full range of options. Of course, unlike the early game, this separation may happen at a different turn, depending on the player, because some might be better at calculating it than others.

Endgame changes in stategy are not numerous, and they basically all gravitate around one simple principle: Get the right people to pick up the cards.

This means that, when in the endgame, even if you have something to play, you can't play it until you reach a stage where you should pick up a new card. This might mean giving low-value clues, or even zero-value clues, to delay picking up cards.

Discarding is allowed in the endgame, but only for a player who needs to pick up a card, but has nothing to play. Playing is always preferred to discarding if possible

If you give low-value clues in the endgame, you should make them obvious. One of the hard parts of the endgame is giving tempo clues without triggering unwanted finesse plays. This is especially problematic if some players haven't realised that we're in the endgame now.

When in the end game, context is extremely important to make the distinction between finesse and tempo clue.

For example, you are missing the green 3, 4 and 5. You have the 5 (known), you see the 4 in the third player's hand, but not the 3. You know it is in the deck, because of whatever reason. You decide to pre emptively clue the 4, so that the player next to you can try to pick up the 3, because once they do, you will not get a chance to clue the 4. It would be a tempo clue, to make sure all 3 cards are playable when you find the #3. In non-endgame situations, cluing that 4 would trigger a finesse on the other player. But in the endgame, this clue is crucial, which means you cannot assume it's a finesse.

Usually, in that case, if you have enough clues, the other player can assume that if he had the 3, you'd clue the 3, he's clue the 4, the other guy would stall, and everyoe ould play one turn later. But if you are low on clues, that's not an option. Then, if you can, you should clue the number 4, so that there is no risk of the card being played thinking it's a 3, but even that's not garanteed. If the other guy sees you gave the number when the color would have worked, he can figure out it's not a finesse. But if the color wouldn't have worked, or if you give the color because the number doesn't work, then it can get extremely hard to tell.

Basically, there is no set of conventions that is garanteed to get you out of this mess. If you are low on clues, and both color and number clues on the 4 are ambiguous, or even impossible, it's impossible to tell if it's tempo or finesse, because in both cases you'd be doing the same thing.

What I recommend, as the second player, if it's ambiguous, brute force it. What score do you finish with if you misplay right now, if you play the 3 correctly right now, and if you wait. Choose the mathematically optimal option. It won't always work, but I don't have a better solution

Hanabi Technique of the day #42: The Ambiguous Gentleman's Discard

TL;DR - You can do a gentleman's discard on a card even if you arent sure of its identity, as long as every possible duplicate is on a playable finesse.

Reminder: Gentleman's discard (HtotD #25) is when you know 100% the identity of one of your card, and you discard it, as a message to the person who has the other copy that they can play it. By itself, it has no value, but in some situations, it can lead to a gain of tempo or efficiency, for exemple if the other copy of the card is layered behind something else that is also playable.

Now, in some situations, you don't know the exact identity of a card, but you have an idea. For example, you know it's a 2, and there are only two 2s left that are playable. From Good Touch, you can expect that it is one of those. You don't know which.

If you happen to see, during a turn, both of the playable 2s on finesse position (or layered behind playable cards), then you can do an ambiguous gentleman's discard. You discard yours, without knowing what it is. Everyone will first try to figure out if you could have known what it is, somehow. You cannot perform this move if the other players are in a situation where they may think you know the exact identity. Since they figure out that you can't, then they figure out your list of potential cards. From there, they can extrapolate that all the cards on this list are both visible and playable right now. Looking at each other, each player determines they have all the cards they don't see.

From there, maybe some of them can play right away, or maybe they have to wait, but they know about the card. IF they have to wait, the card cannot be layered behind something else, because they will progress with an incorrect information for more than one turn, and this is very risky.

If one of the players has many of the cards, he is not garanteed anything about their order, and as soon as they are all playable, will play them starting on the finesse. Again, there can only be unrelated playable cards in the sequence if they are expected to start blind playing right away.

I'm not satisfied with my explanation, but I can't figure out how to make it better. If you want more details or an example, feel free to ask me about it

    Hanabi Technique of the day #43: The Occupied Play Clue

TL;DR - Save clues are not very efficient and should only be given when the card is at risk of being discarded, or if you have nothing better to do (it's still better than discarding!). If you have something better to do, and you decided to save a card that was not in immediate danger, it must be something better in itself. It should be interpreted as a pay clue in this case. Finesses can follow.

While discarding is the last resort move, giving uneeded save clues is also pretty bad. Save clues should be given either when a card is in direct danger of being discarded (the player may choose to discard on their turn), or as a form of stalling when there is nothing better to do.

For example, in the early game, we give pre-emptive save clues a lot.

Once you reach the mid game, if the person with a critical card on chop has something to do on their turn (ex: a playable card), the card is not considered i immediate danger, and you should try to do a more efficient move than a save clue here. Play clues are much more efficient tempo-wise.

If yo do have something better to do, then anyone who sees that "better" play will not expect you to give a save. In this case, you can give a play clue that should look like a save clue, as long as this person is the one that has to interpret it.

For example, you can clue a playable, non-critical red 3 on a chop with the color "red", even if there exists a critical red 4, if the receiver of the clue can see you had better options, because then they can understand it is not a save on the 4, therefore it is playable.

Same logic goes if you had something to play, and could have let someone else do the save, yet decide to do it. You were occupied, yet decided to waste tempo, so it can't possible be an uneeded save, it must be a play.

Basically if your turn was supposed to be occupied with something else (better clues, playable cards, etc), people should understand that your clue was not a pre-emptive save.

In the same line of thought, you can do Occupied Finesses, Prompts and bluffs.

This time, the person does have the critical 4 on chop, and you clue red. It looks like a save clue. In this case, it doesn't matter if they understand or not. Somebody else as red 3 on finesse position. If that other person can see that you had something better to do (for example, there was something else cluable in the 4 owner's hand that could have been played right away, thus delaying the critical discard). From this they can understand it is in fact not a save, therefore a play clue, therefore somebody has the 3, and they don't see it, so they play it. Once they play, the owner of the 4 can understand what happened and play too.

This move requires people to trust that you usually don't give uneeded saves instead of better clues.

    Hanabi Bonus Technique of the day #1: Critical Variant Save Clues

TL;DR - When saving black cards on chop, give the number if it is 1, 2 or 5 (1 is playable), give the color if it is 3 or 4. If you want them played instead, go for the other option.

Critical variants are the selection of variants that contain at least one suit where each card is unique. Those suits are the critical suits. The first critical variant is Black variant, where the black suit is critical, therefore each black card is unique. For the rest of this post, I will talk about black cards, because "critical cards" already has a meaning. Everything should be relevant for any critical variant, not just black.

In a critical variant, an entire suit is unique. Every time one of those cards reaches the chop, it must be saved.

If it is not on chop, clues act literally the same as with any other suit. It's a play unless it's a fix. Give the color if you can, number otherwise, make sure your focuses work. Only one touched card is important now, but all touched cards should be non-trash.

If it is on chop, you have to think a little differently.

First of all, if you get a 1 clue on chop, then it's a play clue, regardless of critical suit or not. 1s are either playable or trash, if it gets a clue, it's playable.

If you get a 2-clue or a 5-clue, the reasoning is the exact same as for non-critical suits, save clue interpretation takes priority, since we always save those numbers anyway. The only difference is that if a player misses the save clue on black 2, and thinks it's a play clue, instead of making it "much more likely to lose the game", as misplaying a 2 usually does, now it's a garanteed defeat.

If you get a 3-clue or a 4-clue, you figure out if it is a save clue by looking at the discard pile for cards of that number that are critical. You should not save black 3 and black 4 with the number!. If there are no standard suit cards that this could be, it is a play clue, even if black 3 and black 4 are critical.

If you get a black clue, you should assume it is a save clue, until proven otherwise. Since only black 3 and 4 should be saved with the color, if you ever see those cards, then you can retroactively figure out your clue was a play clue.

There is one exception: If the black clue touched multiple cards, including the chop, then it should be takenas a save clue regardless. Pre-emptively saving another black card trumps any advantage gained by sticking to number clues to save 2s and 5s, which mean you can save a black 2 or black 5 on chop with the color, if you touch a least one more new black card in the person's hand. If you receive a black clue where the focus is the chop and there are 2+ new cards touched, it is a save, regardless.

    Hanabi Technique of the day #44: Early Game Principles

TL;DR - No TL;Dr today, because the technique is really a list of short ideas itself.

It is sometimes hard to figure out what to do in the first few turns of the early game. Here are a few things you should consider. There is no order for what is better or worse, because it is all highly circumstancial. Judge for yourself, with what you know of the table, what is better for a given turn.

High efficiency plays: How many cards can you get played with one clue? Can you get a card played and a card saved for later with a bluff?

High Tempo plays: Get the player right next to you to play something right away, especially if you see the follow-up cards already on the table.

Responsibility plays: You see a great play, but the player right after you could also do it. Can you let him do it? Are the cards placed in such a way that maybe your hand allows him to do even better?

Dead-End Plays: Even if you have playable cards, if they lead to nothing as far as you know, make sure you think about what clues you could give. It's better to give a good clue than to play a dead-end card, but it's better to play any card than to give a clue that someone who has no playable cards could give themselves.

Planning for 5 stalls: Which 5s can be used for stalling? Is there anyone who doesn't see a 5 anywhere? Are they at risk of killing the early game? Can you make sure they have something to do?

Letting people do bluffs: Bluffs are great in the early game. If you can get a card played, but maybe someone else can bluff it, maybe let them have the chance? In the early game, most of the time, bluffs are superior to finesses, which means that even if you can finesse a card by cluing the follow-up, you might prefer to bluff it with something unrelated, and get the follow-up later with a different clue.

Prioritizing non-finessable cards: If you can't do a finesse or a bluff, and must clue something the boring way, choose something as far from newest card as possible, because it is the most unlikely to be finessable by someone else.

Keep ambiguity low: If you can get someone to play something by being sure of what it is, it is much better, because they still have the options of doing good clues themselves instead of playing if they have the chance. If you clue "1s" to somebody, he can't know which is which until all are played, and therefore may have to give up on good finesses because he doesn't know if he would duplicate the 1.

    Hanabi Technique of the day #45: Locked Hand and Anxiety Play

TL;DR - If your entire hand is clued, the other players must leave you clues, and you must use them even for low-value clues. If they don't leave you a clue, it means you can play something.

Sometimes, an entire player's hand is saved and touched by clues, yet none of the cards are playable. This player can neither play nor discard, so he must give a clue every turn. It is the other player's responsibility to make sure he has at least one clue token every turn.

When the time comes for them to actually play one of the cards, the other players can signal that by not leaving them a clue. Once that happens, it is a called an Anxiety play. The player has to play something right now, and must choose wisely. He should consider not only the information he has from the clues, but also the contextual information of the clues (when it was saved, what cards could have been "to save"on that turn?). He should figure out exactly which of his cards are possibly playable, and play the most recent from that sub group.

The other players should be able to infer similar information, and only give an anxiety play contextual clue when it will result in a successful play.

Sometimes, the other players see different things, and some may not see that they can do a contextual play. Ex: The playable card is red4, saved with 4, at a time when red4 and white4 were critical, but now somebody else picked up white4. The player who is giving the contextual anxiety play clue is the player right before, because they are the one who could have ultimately discarded to make a clue. They are the one who needs to see what is necessary for the anxiety play. In the example, if they had the white4, they can't do it.

Hanabi Technique of the day #46: Misplay Cost Principle (When to give fix clues)

TL;DR - Only fix an impending misplay if you are on the last life, or if the card is important.

Often, in hanabi (especially beginner games), mistakes will be made. Sometimes, in higher level games, good clues will be given, with a lie component. In both cases, somebody thinks they have a specific card (or one of X possible cards), but it is false. This is called an impending misplay.

It is reasonable to expect that, at some point in the game (maybe now), enough cards will be played and picked up for the person to determine that their card is playable (it's not), and misplay.

But it is also possible that, before that point arrives, enough cards are picked up or played to make it obvious to the person that their information is incorrect. For example, if they believe that their clued red card is red 5 for whatever reason (and it's a trash red instead), then if the red 4 is played, they will misplay, but if anyone picks up the real red 5 before then, they will understand and discard the trash red.

This is why giving fix clues should never be done pre-emptively. The table should wait until the misplay now to fix it, just in case they can get away with not fixing it before then. It is also much easier to identify fix clues if you assume they are not given pre-emptively (except in situations where the player is allowed to give a low-value clue.

Now, even when the impending misplay is now, you have to evaluate the value of fixing it.

If the player misplays, two things happen:
First, we lose a life. We have 3 of those, and the final score does not depend on the number we have left. If we are on the last life, all misplays need to be fixed.
Second, we lose the card. If the card is critical, we must give the fix clue. If the card is semi-critical and the other copy is not visible, it is also usually worth fixing it to save that card.

If the card is trash or future trash and we have lives left, it may not be worth fixing. Fixing costs a clue, and the person will discard it, generating a clue. clue total is +0, one trash was lost, and two turns of tempo were used. If you don't fix, clue total is +0, you lose one life and one trash, and one turn of tempo was lost. Basically, not fixing saves one turn of tempo at the cost of one life.

If your team is still in a stage where they lose most games to lives lost, you may prefer to save a life than a turn of tempo. But when you reach the point where you get most defeats by lack of efficiency or tempo, you may want to sacrifice that life.

You should also evaluate contextually if, after the misplay, everyone will understand what happened or be confused. Confusion is dangerous in Hanabi, and that alone might be enough to make the fix worth it.

This has to be determined on a case by case basis, but you need to understand that not all impending misplays need to be fixed (smile)

    Hanabi Technique of the day #47: Double Bluffs

Not to be confused with HTotD #29: Double Half Bluffs

TL;DR - You can use a 2-away card to bluff, to get the next two finesse positions, containing unrelated cards, to get played.

Definition of x-away card: A card where exactly x cards of the same color have to be played for it to become playable.

In a normal bluff, you clue a 1-away card, to get an unrelated card played by the person on your left, because they think it is the missing card.

In a double half bluff, you clue a 2-away card when someone has the first missing card, and the person on their left has an unrelated playable card that they will play, believing it is the second missing card.

In a triple two-thirds bluff, you clue a 3-away card, to get the first two missing cards played, and an unrelated bluffed.

In a 3-bluff, you clue a 3, regardless of what its x-away value is, to get an unrelated card played (this is a convention!)

In a double bluff, you can clue a card that is 2-away, so that the two players going next blind play unrelated cards. The expected cards are not available to play.

For example: You clue "red" on red4, while only red1 is played. The player on your left believes they have red2 and red3, so they play their finesse. It works, but is not red2. Now the next player, from context, can understand they don't have red2, and that it was a bluff. But since they trust that you only give good bluffs, and that bluff was neither an incomplete bluff, a 1-away bluff, or a 3-bluff, they can understand that it was a double bluff, and also play, knowingly, an unrelated card.

You can also do triple  and quadruple bluffs, technically, if are lucky enough.

Double bluffs requires the first person to trust you with layered finesses, and the second person to have very high trust that you master all previous forms of bluff. Do not attempt double bluffs yet if you have a history of messing up simpler bluffs, because the move relies heavily on trust.

    Hanabi Technique of the day #48: The Repeat Fix Clue

TL;DR - If a clue gives absolutely zero new information, doesn't gain any tempo, and overall looks totally useless, and the person was not in a zero-value clue situation (or had something better to do), then it must be taken as a fix clue.

Sometimes, someone will be 100% convinced that their card is something in particular, and be wrong. Someone has to give them a fix clue when the time comes for them to misplay it, to save a life.

Any clue that "changes" what they believe will be taken as a fix clue.

But sometimes, you cannot change what they think. For example, they have a clued "green" card, green4, that they believe is green3, and you can't reasonably give "4" without duplicating, touching trash, or something.

Now if this is their only green card, they know that you know that they are about to play it, and you clue "green" again on it, the clue will seem totally, 100%, useless. Now of course, if they have low trust for you, they might just say "I already knew that", roll their eyes, and misplay anyway. But if you never make that kind of mistake, and therefore they can trust you, they should understand that this means "what you currently think, is actually wrong"

Now that you understand "this was actually wrong", you know two things: This is not green three, and this is a useful green. Therefore, you know it's either 4 or 5, and as soon as you know which through context, you can play it when it's playable.

If it happens that there are no more useful cards that match the clue but are not what you thought, then your card is officially trash, and you can throw it. Basically, Good Touch Principle (HTotD #2) takes precedence, so you still assume it's non-trash if possible, but if not, then it must be.

Pretty much most interpretations take priority over repeat fix clues, because there are many reasons why somebody would clue a known card again. Only if all of those reasons don't apply (play clue, finesse, tempo clue, etc) can you understand it as a repeat fix clue.

Hanabi Technique of the day #49: Stomping on a finesse


TL;DR - If someone gives a play clue on a card that was finessed, depending on how much you trust them, it is either a finesse stomp (big mistake), or a fix clue telling you "actually don't"


In beginner games, something extremely common is players stomping on finesses. It means they wasted a clue to give a direct clue on a card that was already finessed (and about to be blind played anyway). Usually, the player either doesn't understand finesses yet, or still has trouble identifying them. Somehow, they missed the finesse and tried giving a good play clue.


Finesse stomps are usually pretty easy to identify as such, because the player who does it usually does it a lot, until some point, when they "get it" and stop almost completely.


Now, if the player who did it is one you have high trust for, especially for this beginner mistake, then it means something else.


First of all, all cards that are "to be blind played" as considered as "clued" when figuring out the focus of a clue. So, if something else was also touched, maybe the clue is not a finesse stomp, but simply a different clue taking into account that you understood the finesse (if they trust you).


Then, in some cases, they will only touch the finessed card, and it can be interpreted as a repeat fix clue on the finessed card.

Basically, once your team reaches a certain level of play, you can stop assuming that finesse stomps are mistake, and actually look for the real meaning behind the clue. If there is a real meaning, then it is not a finesse stomp. If there is not, the mistake is on them.

    Hanabi Technique of the day #50: Information priority

TL;DR - If you have the choice between playing a card with a known exact identity, and an unknown one, the unknown one takes priority so that you can see what it is and use the information afterwards

Most of the time, in Hanabi, when you are playing a card, you know exactly which card it is. But in some cases you don't. Those cases mostly happen with 1s (you know it's a playable 1, yet you don't know which) and in ambiguous cluing variants (like rainbow).

When you know about your cards, you can use that information in your decisions. For example, there is no need to save a 2 on chop if you have the same 2 already clued in your hand. Sometimes you can even give play clues on cards that rely on your cards to be played first (if it doesn't ruin tempo).

Point is, the more precise your information is, the more educated your decisions can be.

When you have unknown clued playable cards, you are much more limited. For example, if you have clued playable 1s, you can't clue any 1 in anyone's hand until they are played, because there is a high risk of duplication. If the cards are indeed different, you may lose one turn of tempo because you had to let someone else clue it.

Furthermore, even if you have multiple playable clued cards, if any of them is unknown, you cannot perform priority plays, because you can't evaluate reliably what order to play in.

Therefore, when evaluating what to play, unknown cards take priority over known ones, only because as soon as you play it, you know what it is, and you become more efficient.

Blind plays are still more important

Order: Blind Plays -> Unknown cards -> Cards that let somebody else play now -> Cards that let you play now -> 5s -> lowest ranked cards -> most recent card

This technique has to be taken with a grain of salt, and evaluated on a case by case basis. Sometimes, you can infer the information from context, and therefore have no need to play the "unknown" card first. Sometimes, you can't infer the identity, but you can determine that knowing the identity is useless (ex: you have a playable 5. You will never worry about duplication, or miss the chance to clue the (non-existent) next card of its color). Because of this, absolutely no priority moves can be done using the fact that a card was unknown, because it is impossible to figure out if somebody else could get this information from context.

Extra information: Starting 1s principle, which tells you the order to play 1s if you have the choice, only applies to unknown 1s. The technique exists because having many unknown playable 1s is extremely common (as opposed to, for example having many unknown playable 4s). If you have known 1s, you should play the unknown 1s first, regardless of hand order.

    Hanabi Technique of the day #51: Pang of Guilt

TL;DR - Every time you give a play clue on a card that was on finesse position (or layered), you shoud feel a pang of guilt. Somebody (maybe you?) could have finessed or bluffed this in most cases.

Efficiency is critical to victory in Hanabi, and the Finesses (and bluffs) are still our most powerful tools for that.

Many times during the game, players will pick up playable cards. Of course, letting the card sit there for several turns is horrible for tempo. But when you see it the first time, you should look around for a way to finesse it. If you can, do it. If you can't, even if you have nothing else to do otherthan discarding, you shouldn't clue it directly.

Maybe your hand contains what is needed to finesse it, and you just stole a finesse from another player. You should feel guilty.

If another player has already ignored the card for a move like discarding, you know they didn't see what they needed to finesse it. Even then, maybe the player on its right can bluff it. If you clue it directly, you're stealing this away from them. You should feel guilty.

Of course, cluing it is better than double discarding. But if you can find anything else to do instead, do it, and let someone have the chance to bluff it.

Common sense applies. for example, if the player in bluff seat has many playable cards, you might prefer that they bluff, rather than bluff it.

Point is: Gett he habit of feeling guilty when you give a direct clue on it. Then, you will be checking for alternatives, and only doing so when you have carefully evaluated that you couldn't do anything better.

Also, if you have the choice between giving a play clue on a finessable card, or on a different card in a non-finessable position, go for the non-finessable one. That seems obvious, but is actually quite a frequent mistake.

Let other players do finesses where you can't.

Hanabi Technique of the day #52: The self-deprecation 5 misplay


Normally, if clued 5 is misplayed despite none of the 4s being played yet, it would be a huge mistake.


However, if player does this deliberately, something extra will be communicated. 


If a clued 5 is played before any of the 4s have been played, the player communicates the fact that they royally screwed up.


Example:

 - None of the 4s have been played on the table. 

 - Alice clues Bob "5" on one card that is on chop. 

 - Bob plays the 5 immediately. 

 - Both Cathy and Alice now know that Bob has royally screwed up. 

 - Alice and Cathy can now judge Bob silently, say "oof", or bully him. Maybe all of the above.

 - Alice and Cathy invent a new Technique of the day, which is simply "Don't trust Bob", or even "Don't play with Bob"

    Hanabi Technique of the day #53: The Dump Truck

TL;DR - Blind Misplay your chop in the early game to signal one player to blind play his entire hand from newest to oldest



	
This move is a convention. It is not possible to logically figure out this move from first principles only, and should therefore only be used when the relevant players already know about it.




	
This moves sacrifices a life for the sake of efficiency or tempo. It should not be used in games where the players often lose 2 or more lives to mistakes


During the early game, reasonably often, one player will have a hand that is entirely playable from newest to oldest. Of course, the in the ideal scenario, you can finesse their oldest card with something, therefore getting their entire hand + 1 cards played with a single clue, because of the deep layers.

But what if the next card is not available? This kind of move is so efficient that we can't afford to randomly clue some cards in the hand one at a time. That is the time to perform a Dump Truck.

If you blind play your chop, purposely sacrificing a life and an unknown card, it must mean that something extremely efficient is available right now. Every player looks at other hands, and if they can't see an entirely playable hand, it means they have one. The dump trucked player starts dumping his entire hand on the table from newest to oldest, completely ignoring all clues he already received

Performing a Dump Truck always sacrifices a life, so you have to consider if it's worth it with your current group. Furthermore, you sacrifice one card. To minimize that loss as much as possible, here are safeties measures when performing a dump truck.



	
Only perform Dump Trucks in the early game. If the worst case scenario happens, and you lose a critical card (ex: a 5), you can just screw that game and restart. Make sure your group is fine with that, if it happens. This will make the worst case scenario waste as little time as possible for your group.
	If you see a dump truck available, but not on the very next player, consider letting someone else do it (before the trucked player gets a turn, of course). If the last player (before the trucked player has a turn) has a 5 or 2 on chop, then the player before him should do it to prevent losing this card, and if they also have a 5 or 2, the previous player should do it, and so on. If you perform it, all players between you and the truck should consider themselves chop moved.

Lastly, if you happen (very rare) to see two players that can be dump trucked, blind misplay your second oldest card instead of your oldest to signal "there are two trucks". Anyone who sees only one, knows they are the other one. This can technically be extended for the number of unclued cards/players there are. Blind misplay third oldest to signal 3 trucks, etc.

    Hanabi Technique of the day #54: The Distributed Dump Truck

TL;DR - In 5+ players game, pretend to do a dump truck when nobody has a truck hand, to get everyone to blind play precisely one card



	
	
This move is a convention. It is not possible to logically figure out this move from first principles only, and should therefore only be used when the relevant players already know about it.
	




	
	
	
This moves sacrifices a life for the sake of efficiency or tempo. It should not be used in games where the players often lose 2 or more lives to mistakes
	
	


The dump truck is a powerful move, it gets 4 or 5 cards played for one life. It has been calculated that this is a ratio that is "worth it", therefore playing with conventions that lose a life for 4+ cards is better than not doing so, on average. Fewer cards than that is not worth it.

Like most moves, Dump Truck can be lies, as long as it is still worth it. If you ever pretend to do a dump truck (Misplay your chop in the early game for no apparent reason), the player right next to you will start playing, since they don't see any other entirely playable hand. They will think they are being dump trucked. Therefore, you are bluffing their newest card.

Now, as soon as they play in the dump truck, everyone else understands that it was not a real one, but the player who played still doesn't know. To resolve the situation, somebody else must attempt to play into it. The next player will then also blind play their newest card.

Technically, the move is over, since everybody understands at this point. But if it was the case, it would have gotten two cards for one life, which would be a shit move. Everything it means after that is purely convention.

The Distributed Dump Truck convention dictates that this move actually means for every other player to blind play their newest card, immediately without delay (because some of the cards may rely on each other). It is also only usable in games with 5+ players, because only in those games are there 4 cards (or more) played with this move.

Basically, you get everyone to do a group Dump Truck, and dump one card each.

Just like the real dump truck, you can also do higher-value variations, each exponentially less likely to be available than the previous one. You misplay the second card to get everyone to blind play two cards, and so on.

    Hanabi Technique of the day #55: The Oof

TL;DR - Don't randomly oof everything you don't understand, but don't let a real oof pass without taking it

If you play a lot, especially with players that have less experience than you do, you may be tempted to Oof them a lot. But you have to be careful about what is and is not oof-worthy.

For something to be an oof, it must fulfill the following criteria:

1: There is no universe in which the move is actually good. You must be 100% sure that it is a mistake, otherwise your oof will be an oof, when the move turns out to have been good.

2: The mistake is not something the player is expected to miss. It is something they should already know and should not be making mistakes on

3: The difference in value between the chosen move and the expected moves is big. Don't oof when there was something slightly better but the move is almost as good.

4: Nobody has oofed the mistake yet. An oof is a non-distributable experience.

5: The oof itself gives no, or very little, information about the table to players. It is okay if the oof makes the mistake-doer realize why he got oofed, if he could have known without it, and was expected to. Don't oof if the move looks great to somebody, because you just told them "it's not what you think" and that is big table talk

Notable Exceptions:

- Keep oofs light and sparse with beginners so they don't feel inadequate
- Try not to always oof the same person, even if they do make more mistakes than everyone else, so that they don't stop taking oofs seriously. If you find yourself oofing someone all the time, re-adjust your trust level in them, start expecting slightly more mistakes (criteria 2), and rebalance your oofs
- Don't oof on mistakes that you yourself make fairly often, because you will come across as an hypocrite

Hanabi Technique of the day #56: The Tempo Clue Chop Move

TL;DR - If a tempo clue is given and it doesn't bring anything else than the tempo, the tempo wasn't critical and low-value clues weren't allowed, it should be taken as a chop move


	
	
This move is part of the chop move category
	



Check out HTotD #28 for a reminder of what Tempo Clues are

Check out HTotD #22, #23, #24 for other types of Chop Moves

Tempo clues can have many different meanings, but it always comes down to this. How valuable was it, and was it worth it. If your analysis brings you to the answer "no", it means there is a part of the clue you don't see.

Since tempo clues are allowed in low-value situations, if the player was in one and had nothing obviously better to do, then of course you can't imagine anything.

But if they chose this clue, even with the low-value, that means there is something more. The only person who can't see that "more" thing must have it, as always.

If you received the clue, and can't see the "more" thing, and there was a reasonable risk of you discarding on this turn, you can easily deduce that they did it to get you to play instead of discarding. You should consider it a chop move, and consider your current chop "saved" with no clues. The next card is now your real chop.

Hanabi Technique of the day #57: Lie components

TL;DR - You can add a lie component to moves when it's worth it, as long as you are 100% sure that you can fix it before it becoms problematic.


Player2 has a yellow 2 somewhere

Player3 has : r1, r2, b1, g5, y1


Now you might be thinking "if only that g5 wasn't here, I could do a great 5 for 1 finesse! Now I'll have to clue y1 directly instead..."


But you shouldn't. You see g5 one-away from chop and no green cards are played yet. You know 99.999% that this g5 will require a save clue at some point before becoming playable. Therefore, it will cost the same number of clues to save it later, or to fix it before the finese makes it misplayed.


You can do the finesse. Clue y2. Player3 will play r1. Since you can't bluff him, he'll keep going. He will play r1, r2, b1, and when he's about to misplay g5, fix it by telling him "actually, that is a 5".


Lie components work on the basis of promises. If you finesse something, you promise someone that they can play the required card. In the case of a bluff, this is a hard lie, because the card doesn't actually exist. But in the case of a lie component, it is a soft lie. You promised the card was playable, which is true, and you implied that it will get found without an extra clue, which was not true. Still, you wanted them to look for it, to play more free cards.


A lie component can be done on anyone, because it is fairly easy to identify for everyone else. But a lie component requires a fix later, and the fix must be given by the person who did the original clue. This is because in some cases, it's not actually a lie component, and instead someone else can play what's missing for the layers to become playable, so no fix will be given. It is impossible, as a third player, to tell if it is a lie component that requires fixing or a layered finesse that requires them to play, so they can't fix it.


If you give the lie, you must fix it. You must make sure before giving it that you will be able to fix it when the time comes, and you must not fix it pre-emptively.


When you fix it, you have two options. Either you fix by telling them where the real card they are looking for is, or you fix by telling them the cards in between are not what they think they are.


If the unplayable cards are trash, or there are more than one and can't be touched with one clue, you should clue the real card (in the example, yellow). If there is exactly one unplayable card, or several with a common characteristic you can clue, and you want to save it/them for later, you should touch that card instead as the fix, saying "skip over those when you keep looking", and they shall be considered saved for later.


You should wait until the turn right before the mistake happens to give the fix, because all cards between the real expected card and the last played card will not be played after fixing, so let them play them before fixing.


Analyze the situation beforehand. Make sure doing the lie component finesse is worth it, including the cost of the fix. Often, it is.

    Hanabi Technique of the day #58: Lines

TL;DR - Potential futures are tree of possible actions, your goal is to choose the best branch every turn, and those are called lines

If anyone has ever heard of decision trees and algorithms such as minimax, this will be obvious to you.

Every time a player does anything, they have a finite set of possible actions (4-5 discard actions, 4-5 play actions, up to 44 clue actions), and they have to choose one. Some are better than others by a large difference, and some are pretty close. Most importantly, all those actions will create a slightly different game state for the next player, affecting their own set of possible actions. That is a decision tree with multiple players.

Once you choose one of your 50+ branches, all other branches are closed off permanently. The set of remaining actions is also a tree, it is the sub-tree of your move.

Unlike a versus game, in which you must choose the branch that gives the shittiest sub-tree to your opponent, in a cooperative game, all players try to generate the best possible sub trees for each other.

For example, in chess, you don't try to generate a sub tree with one very good branch for you, because you know your opponent will never choose this branch. You try to generate one with as few bad branchs as possible, and the "best" worst-branch possible.

In Hanabi, you can expect your team mate to look for good lines too, so choosing to give them a sub tree with one very good branch is much better than with many mediocre ones.

One path travelling the tree from beginning to end by choosing a branch on each step is called a line. Choosing a branch is called "initiating" a line. You must try to initiate the best possible line on each turn. You look to the next few turns (as far as you can reasonably calculate within a reasonable time), and try to make sure every player gets at least one good branch to choose, including them thinking in the future, etc.

PS: The expected branches should, as much as possible, be RNG-independant. You don't calculate "this move is great if A picks up a specific card, and shit otherwise, so that's one good line, I'll go for it".

You try to get value regardless of RNG, "stable value", and if you can't, you get as stable as possible, which means the action that has the highest chance of not turning to shit.

This entire HTotD is only about predicting rational actions and taking them into account, not predicting the order of the deck. That's a topic for another day.

    Hanabi Technique of the day #59: High Value cards

TL;DR - Critical cards and playable cards are very high value and should not be lost. 3s and 1-away cards are high value and should be kept as much as possible. Semi-criticals that are 2 away are medium value cards, and trash cards are low-value.

In Hanabi, cars have circumstancial value, and it is important to be aware of it. Discarding should be done on the lowest-value car we have available, if possible. Of course, having a chop means you very rarely choose which card you discard. But in many cases, you can choose between discarding, or letting the person after you discard, and you should be aware that the previous players also made that choice.

This means that you can have a rough evaluation of the value of your chop after a while.

While save clues can be given on critical cards, there are many other ways to save cards that can be done on any cards, and should be used on high value cards whenever possible. An entire category of moves (chop moves) is based on saving unknown cards like that.

In order:

Critical cards -> Highest value of all. Losing one of those instantly makes victory impossible. Should be saved at all costs, including using save clues.

Playable cards -> Any card that is playable, where playable includes a card that can't be played now, but we have in our hands everything needed to make it playable, therefore we can have a good estimate of when it will be played, as opposed to if a required card was still in the deck. Very High value, losing them equals a potentially enormous loss of tempo. I you discard one and people had a chance to save it (but didn't), you can assume that the other copy is somewhere. Giving a play clue on it is the preferred method of saving it.

1-away cards -> Cards that only miss one thing to become playable, and will most likely be playable soon. High value, should be chop moved if you don't have both copies. Primary targets for bluffs, because it allows a very efficient save.

3s -> Also high value, 3-bluff technique (HTotD #39) literally only exists to allow more chances to save them. Same value as 1-away cards

2-away cards -> Medium value, estimated to be playable in the medium to long term. Can be chop moved if there is nothing better to do, but most cards are better than it. You are likely to find the other copy before it becomes playable anyway. Can be saved through double-bluffs or similar techniques if you get the chance

Trash cards -> The other copy is played, so we don't need it at all. only is useful for giving known trash in some cases and being discarded. Low value, should never be saved in any way.

Hanabi Technique of the day #60: Discard Modulation

TL;DR - Often, you will only see one clue to give (excluding your hand), and you have to choose between discarding and letting the next player give it, or give it yourself. If you have reason to believe your hop is neither critical not, only let them discard if theirs is low-value or medium value.

Most discards are "blind" discard, which means you don't know what you are discarding. Just like when playing, you have to trust other players about it. It is everyone's job to take care of giving the discards to the lowest-valued chops.

Every time there is a risk of the next player discarding (you don't see your own hand, so you don't know if there are clues to give there), you should think twice about it. Maybe you should discard instead.

Of course, if their chop is low-value (trash), let them do it.

If it is critical or high value, you probably want to discard yourself instead.

If it is medium value, it's situational. Do you believe the previous player would have discarded if yours were higher value?

Basically, estimate if your chop is more important than theirs, and choose which of you discards.

This entire technique only applies to cases where you can reasonably assume one of you will discard, and if not, that the clue you are "stealing" couldn't be done better by them. Efficiency and tempo are more important than discard modulation.

If you see the player before you discard when they have a clue to give, it might mean that your chop seems valuable to them. It could also be something else, so you can't take it for granted. But if it happens twice for the same chop, you should chop-move yourself, and everyone else should assume you are chop-moved.

    Hanabi Technique of the day #61: Ambiguous Finesse Pass-back

TL;DR - You can "pass back" the play on an ambiguous finesse if it is needed or useful, by also not playing on it.

HTotD #36 is the ambiguous finesse, and understanding it is very important for this technique.

When an ambiguous finesse happens, the first player with the card will skip playing, because they see someone else who has it so they don't think they do.

The second player, assuming enough trust, understands that they have it and can blind play. But in some cases, they might prefer to let the first player play it instead.

for example, B and C have blue2 on finesse, and B has blue3 on second newest card. A clues D's blue4 to finesse blue2 and blue3.
B sees a 2 and assumes they have the three, they do nothing.
C was waiting for both the 2 and the 3, and sees the 2 wasn't played. They understand that they also have the 2. But if they play, B will then misplay the other b2 because they think it's a b3.
C doesn't play, to signal to B that they also have the 2, and should play it instead.
B plays blue2
B plays blue3.

In this example, the pass-back was needed. Without doing it, a mistake would have happened.

In some cases, the pass-back is good, but not needed.
Example: B and C have blue2, but B has blue2 on second newest slot, with another playable card on newest. A clues D's blue3.
B sees C's blue2, and passes.
C knows that there are two of them, but sees that on B, it would be layered and get an extra card. They pass-back
B understands that they also have it, and that it is better for them to play. They assume it is layered behind at least one card. They play starting from newest.

Now, If C also had it layered behind a card, B could have understood "I am layered 1+ cards, I will pass-back knowing my newest is an unrelated playable for later". Then, if B was actually layered 2 or more cards, C can understand "I am layered behind 1+ cards, I will pass-back to signal it is still better for him to play. Then B knows it's behind 2+ cards, but if it's the same for C, they pass-back again, etc.

Once somebody finally starts playing, both players should have a very good idea of how deep their layer is. If executed well, lots of cards could get played from both of them.

You can take it even further. If you know "I am layered behind 1+ cards" and want to play the blue2, you can start from second newest to get to it faster for tempo (the 3 is playable after all). Therefore, if you want to pass-back, you can do so by playing the newest card, which you know isn't the blue2. Basically,the consecutive pass-backs can be executed by blind playing other unrelated cards to get maximum tempo and efficiency.

Warning: This move requires incredible trust that players are good with finesses, ambiguous moves, and this move. It can go very wrong very fast if either player screws up.

Hanabi Technique of the day #62: The Positional Misplay

TL;DR - When in a position to do a positional discard, but it is not obvious to the target that you are, and the position to discard is your chop, misplay it instead to convey the same message.



	
	
This move sacrifices a life for the sake of efficiency or tempo. It should not be used in games where the players often lose 2 or more lives to mistakes
	


Refer to HTotD #31 for Positional Discards

You can perform positional discards when two conditions are met: You know that your entire hand is trash, and discarding will not lose critical tempo.

Usually, this happens in the end game. Once all the cards are found, it is easy to figure out if you have none of them (you see all of them). Furthermore, after the last card is drawn, tempo loss will be irrelevant.

But sometimes, you can match condition 1 before then. As soon as you see all useful cards, you know that both your hand and the remaining deck contains none. That can happen way before the endgame.

The problem is that, when it happens, you know your hand is trash, but any player who holds a useful card can't know yet that this stage has been reached.

If you perform a positional discard at that stage, it can still be understood except in one case. Where you discard the chop. Discarding the chop, to the eyes of someone who doesn't see all useful cards, is no different from a normal discard. They can't understand that as a positional discard on someone's chop position.

In this case, you need to make the message clearer. One way to do that is with a positional misplay. Instead of discarding your chop, misplay it. You will communicate the same message, but this time it doesn't look like a "nothing special" move.

    Hanabi Technique of the day #63: The Double Positional Misplay

TL;DR - When in position to do a positional discard, and it would be obvious that it is one, you can do a positional misplay instead to "send th message harder", to mean that two players have playable cards on that slot right now.



	
	
This move sacrifices a life for the sake of efficiency or tempo. It should not be used in games where the players often lose 2 or more lives to mistakes
	


The TL;DR pretty much says it all. If the card is not on chop, or it is widely known that all playable cards are visible, you could do a positional discard with no issue. In that case, do a positional misplay if you want 2 players to play that slot instead of one.


Basically, misplaying the slot instead of discarding is a "stronger" message that means the same thing. So if stronger is needed to be understood, it's a single positional misplay to replace the discard. If it was not, then stronger means actually we want to send a stronger message, so double positional instead of single.

    Hanabi Technique of the day #64: The Baton Discard

TL;DR - You can gentleman's discard a card that is not playable yet on someone's finesse position, but it can't be layered.

Usually, a gentleman's discard concerns a playable card. You discard it (instead of playing) because letting someone else play it is higher value somehow.

But if the card is not playable, you can still do a similar move, and it is very powerful.

You discard as a message "someone else has it [on finesse position unless there is duplication]". The only person who doesn't see it mentally marks the card as that specific identity. They can't play it yet, so they cannot validate the assessment. They need to trust you about it.

Now this move will create a delayed blind play, which means that the move itself must be garanteed unambiguous, otherwise we get information desync. That means you can never perform this move if the card is layered behind other playable cards

This is because if it was, the wrong card would be marked, and the layered blind play would stay "hidden" for potentially many turns, leading to miscommunication. Furthermore, only the specific baton'ed card is marked with an identity. The player is free to discard their other cards when they reach the chop. This means that in case of layer, they may discard the important (and now critical!) card before being able to play.

Hanabi Technique of the day #65: The Skipped Order Chop Move

TL;DR - You can skip over starting 1s in the expected play order to chop move other players. Skip 1 to chop move the player on your left, skip 2 to chop move the next one, etc.



	
	
This move is a convention. It is not possible to logically figure out this move from first principles only, and should therefore only be used when the relevant players already know about it.
	
	
	
This move is part of the order chop move category
	



HTotD #12 explained the order in which to play 1s when you have equal information on them (you know they are 1s, therefore playable, but not which is which). First, 1s that were not in the starting hand, from newest to oldest, then 1s that were in the starting hand, from oldest to newest.


There is a logical reason why this is the best order, it is not a convention. But half of it is very weak.


Playing 1s that were not in the starting hand first is a strong technique. It should not be bypassed for secondary value, because the secondary value gained is most likely going to be less than the value lost by not going for the optimal play. Same goes for their order (newest to oldest).


On the other hand, playing 1s that were in the starting hand from oldest to newest is very weak. It is marginally better than not doing it, but the value gain is extremely small. When everything else is standard, you should definitely do it, because it is better than the alternative. But when you get a chance to bypass it to gain value, it may very well be worth it.


So let's say you have 3 such 1s, that were all in the starting hand. Your "expected" play is the oldest, therefore playing the oldest means nothing special. But you have the choice to play the second or third instead, for very little loss.


The convention is that you can use those alternative moves to signal chop moves. If you "skip" one 1, it means you are chop moving the player on your left. If you "skip" two, you are chop moving the player after that, etc.


Once you have skipped for chop moves, you should come back to the original order afterwards, unless you want to do another chop move of course.


You can use this to chop move anything except a 1 and a non-critical 4. This is especially useful as it is, once again, a way to "save" 3s on chop since we can't give save clues on them. Furthermore, saving 5s and 2s for free is always valuable. Much more valuable than the minuscule value of playing the starting hand 1s in the correct order.


Since this technique only applies to the starting hand, it will most likely only be used in the early game. If you happen to lose a life by doing it, you still have 2 left, don't sweat it. It's nobody's fault, just bad luck. You could say you traded this life for the clue that is saved with the chop move. Trading one life for one clue in the early game is usually worth it.

Hanabi Technique of the day #66: The Double Order Chop Move

TL;DR - In 3-player games, if you do an order chop move poiting to more players away than there are players, it loops around and double-chop moves that player




	
This move is a convention. It is not possible to logically figure out this move from first principles only, and should therefore only be used when the relevant players already know about it.




	
This move only applies to games that have a certain number of players. It doesn't apply to all games.






	
This move is part of the order chop move category




In 3-player games, it is possible to have more playable 1s than there are other players, and more playable 1s to skip over than there are such players.

In that case, we should assume it loops around.

There are two other players, so if you skip over one or two 1s, it applies a normal order chop move on one of the players.

If you have 4 playable 1s, and you skip over 3 of them, it loops back around to chop moving the player on your left, but since you made a conscious choice to skip more cards (bigger danger), it must be because it is more important. We agree that this means you are double chop moving that player (they "blind save" their two oldest unclued cards). If you have 5 playable 1s (very rare), you can skip over four of them for the same result on the player on your right (two seats away)

    Hanabi Technique of the day #67: The Trash Order Chop Move



TL;DR - When you have multiple globally known trash cards, you should discard the newest one first. If you don't, it's a chop move.



	
This move is a convention. It is not possible to logically figure out this move from first principles only, and should therefore only be used when the relevant players already know about it.






	
This move is part of the order chop move category




Sometimes, a player will have multiple globally-known trash cards in his hand. If it comes to discarding, they are all worth the same. We agree to discard the newest one first in this situation, so that when you differ from this convention, it can have a special meaning.

Here, it is the same as with starting 1s. The number of cards you skip in the order is the seat # of the player you want to chop move.

It is important to be aware that this only applies to multiple globally known trash. If one or several of the cards are known trash, but not everyone around the table knows that you know, you may want to choose your order differently to signify information. For example, most of the time if you discard a non-globally known trash, everyone can figure out that if you knew it was trash, all the non-trash options for the cards are already playable.

Example of globally known: All the 1s are played (late mid-game) and you have cards clued "1"
Example of not globally known: the blue4 is played, someone has the blue5 clued as 5 from an earlier save clue, and you have cards clued "blue"

Hanabi Technique of the day #68: The Misplay Chop Move



TL;DR - If you need to save one or many cards on the very next player's chop, and absolutely nothing you think of works, give him a play clue on a trash card as a last resort. He will misplay it instead of discarding a critical card.





	
This move is part of the chop move category




	
	
This move sacrifices a life for the sake of efficiency or tempo. It should not be used in games where the players often lose 2 or more lives to mistakes
	



With the many types of chop moves and clues already described, you can usually find a way to save critical cards. Sometimes, you may get unlucky enough that actually nothing works for your situation.


In this case, there is a last-resort type of chop move, which sacrifices a life to save the critical cards.


You should clue, in the very next player's hand, a trash card, in a way that it looks like a play clue.


On their turn, they should play it (if their chop was at such a high risk, they probably have nothing better to do). It will be a misplay. From seeing what happened, they can understand that, just like in a Trash Chop Move (HTotD #23), you clued a trash to chop move everything older than it in their hand. They should chop move all those older cards, and understand that the situation was bad enough to waste a life and tempo on this.


You should not use this last resort chop move if the card at risk is just a semi-critical like a 3. Only use it on actual criticals, and 2s which should always be considered critical.

Hanabi Technique of the day #69: Elimination Notes

This is the start of Level 3: Advanced strategies

TL;DR - Anytime anything happens, you should figure out what it can mean, and take mental notes for what your related cards are or are not.

While Elimination Notes are only introduced in advanced strategies, any people who gets that far is most likely already using them in some manner. Elimination Notes are also referred to as "contextual information".

Elimination Notes are any information that you get, not from the clues directly, but from paying attention. From noticing what clues were not given, what clues were prioritised over others, etc.

For example, if the team lets you discard a playable card, maybe they didn't get a chance to clue it. But if you saw other players discard earlier when they had clues available, they purposely ignored a chance to clue it, so maybe they wanted you to discard because one of your other cards is the other copy? Then, if you know that one of your other cards is this specific playable card, later if you get a play clue touching one of those cards and a new card, can bypass the standard focus to play the one your elimination notes told you about.

Elimination Notes are a very hard concept that relies very heavily on trust. Once the team is using them, doing anything suboptimal is likely to trigger unwanted Elimination Notes. Again, you probably shouldn't use them on suboptimal plays from a player that you expect that kind of mistake from.

Elimination Notes are a two-way strategy. If you trust that someone uses them well, you can probably figure out what kind of Elimination Notes he is keeping right now, and use that to your advantage.

Example: blue2 is played. A discards when he had available clues. B does whatever. C discards blue3. C notes that one of his 3 other cards is also blue3. D gives C a "blue" clue that touches his newest card and his second oldest. The focus is the newest card (play clue), but C now knows that his second oldest is blue3 (only possibility left). This must be a play clue on blue4, prompting the elimination noted blue3 at the same time.

    Hanabi Technique of the day #70: The Elimination Discard

TL;DR - If your team let you discard an important card (ex: a 2 in the early game), and they had a clear chance to save it, it must mean it didn't need to be saved. You can assume one of your other cards is the same card, and when only one option remains, it is blind playable.



	
This move is part of the Elimination Notes category


Sometimes, important cards are discarded because there wasn't a good chance to save them. But sometimes, there is a good chance, yet it isn't taken and something much less useful is done instead.

For example, a player with available clues discards instead of saving a 2 on a chop. Or a player in double discard situation gives a 5 stall instead of giving a play clue on a playable 3 on chop. You get the idea.

Basically, someone clearly avoids a chance to clue a card that is likely to be lost soon when it really seemed like it should have been clued. If you trust this person to not make this kind of mistake, when you end up discarding the important card and remember the seemingly-wasted clue, you should add elimination notes to the rest of your hand. "One of these cards is the other copy"

Then, as always with elimination notes, you are free to discard some of those cards, and the team should stop you before you reach the critical other copy. But if collateral from other clues (positive and negative) ever removes enough options to only have one left, you know for sure what it is, and you can blind play it whenever it is playable, or use this knowledge in giving your own clues.

This principle also works if you are not the one who discarded. If you are A, see B clearly waste a chance to save a 2 on C's chop, then C discards the 2 and nobody has the other copy, you can assume you have it. The only difference in this case is that you have one extra candidate for which card it can be (because you didn't discard).

Hanabi Technique of the day #71: The Elimination Riding Deduction

TL;DR - If you have two options left with elimination notes for a critical card, and one is your chop, if people would have let you discard on this turn, you know it's not that one, and can play the other one.



	
	
This move is part of the Elimination Notes category
	


Most of the time, elimination notes will concern a critical card, because the easiest way to get elimination notes is by discarding the first copy.

Now, if you have elimination notes on 3 cards, saying that one of them is the last red3 (playable), you can't know where it is. If your turn comes and there is nothing to do and nobody saved your chop, then your chop isn't red3, you can safely discard.

After that happened enough times, you will be left with two cards that could be the critical red3. Your chop, and the next card. If it is the chop, the team will save it before you get a turn where you are at risk of discarding.

Following that logic, if you reach a turn where you are about to discard and nobody saved it, you know your chop isn't the red3, because the Team had no problem letting that possibly critical "ride" on chop and be at risk, so it must not actually be critical. Therefore, you know that the other card is red3, and you can just play it instead of discarding.

For this to work, you have to make sure the did actually got a chance to save your chop (and didn't), and that it was known that you had a risk of discarding on this turn.

    Hanabi Guest Technique of the day #1: The Elimination Riding Layered Prompt
    - By Guillaumes[1]

TL;DR - If you see someone in a position to use #72, but the card they want is on chop, and the other card is playable, just let them believe it is the other way around to get both played



	
	
	This move is part of the Elimination Notes category
	
	


When someone has elimination notes about a playable card, and you know it, and there are only two possibilities remaining (chop and another card), letting the important card "ride" the chop is dangerous, so if nobody does anything, they will use HTotD #71 and be able to blind play the other card.

If the other card is what they want, then everything is fine.

On the other hand, if the chop is actually what they want, but it happens that the other card is also playable, you can purposely let the important card ride the chop on a risky turn, trusting that they will blind play the other card, it will work, and then there is only one option left for their elimination notes, so they will play the desired card right after.

Using this trick, you can get an extra card played for zero clues, just by not saving the chop.

This technique require really high elimination notes trust both ways. You must trust that they have the correct notes to actually attempt the blind play, they must trust that you wouldn't let them discard the other card, you must trust that they trust you enough to attempt the blind play, and once the first play is done, they must trust that it wasn't an accident.

You should not use this technique if there is any chance that the player will choose to do a more important move on their turn (ex: a scream discard), because even if they understand everything going on, they still believe the chop is a safe discard until they actually blind play.

Hanabi Technique of the day #72: The Elimination Layered Play Clue

TL;DR - If a player has elimination notes about a playable card, you can play clue the next card with wrong focus, as long as the clue clarifies their elimination notes enough to pinpoint the location of the first card.



	
This move is part of the Elimination Notes category


Elimination-noted cards interact with focuses in a complicated way. If you have elimination notes (ex: red3 is one of those 3 cards), but don't know which one, all the cards are considered "untouched" when calculating the focus of a clue.

However, as soon as the elimination clarifies enough to be unambiguous (ex: you get "4" on two of the three cards, so you know the other card is red3), the elimination noted card is considered as clued for focus calculation purposes.

Specifically, those two things can happen simultaneously with one clue.

Example with hands (chop on the right), red3 is playable


A: red4, blue1, yellow4, red3 - has elimination notes saying red3 is one of the three oldest cards


B clues "red" to A, touching red4 and red3. The focus would be red3 (chop), but since this clue makes the elimination notes clear enough to know red3's precise location, it is considered clue, so the focus is actually red4 (newest of the "new" cards touched, because red3 is not considered an unclued card from this collateral information, so the new chop wasn't touched)

This is a play clue on red4, because it is playable, provided that A knows the exact location of red3 and will know he has to play it first.

if A had another red in one of the middle slots, then the clue would only be a play clue on red3 (chop focuses) because there wouldn't be enough collateral information to know its exact identity before calculating focus.

Basically, use the collateral information from the clue with your elimination notes before calculating the focus, because it can affect it.

Hanabi Technique of the day #74: The Elimination Play

TL;DR - If a player plays a clued card that they shouldn't have known is playable from your perspective, you should write elimination notes about your hand for the cards he needed to see in order to play it.




	
This move is part of the Elimination Notes category



Usually, when a card is clued but not playable, its precise identity is likely to be unknown (exceptions: if it was the clue of a bluff or a similar move)

There are two ways that this card will get played. 1: It will get played as a result of another clue, either directly or not (prompt, layered anything, tempo clue, etc). 2: It will get played when there is enough information to do so safely. For example, if you have a 2, even if you don't know the color, once all of the 1s are played, you can play it.

This second scenario can happen before everyone knows it. For example, if the only unplayable 2 is green, and you see the green2 clued in someone else's hand, then you can safely play by trusting it wasn't duplicated. In the same line of thought, if you see both green2s anywhere, even unclued, it is obviously also safe.

When you do play, anyone who doesn't see sufficient information for you to play should understand that the missing factors is in their hand but there is no promise of where. They should take elimination notes for the relevant cards.

The same goes for color. If you have a red card, and the pile is up to 3, as soon as the 5 is picked up, you can play.

In some cases, if you clearly demonstrated a non-willingness to play on the previous turn (example: you discarded), the elimination noted players should understand that at least one of the required cards just got picked up and is on newest slot. Again, there is no garantee of which card is there (if there are multiple options). Furthermore, only one card is garanteed to have been just picked up, so if there were more in several hands, they will all see each other and won't be able to play on it.

    Hanabi Technique of the day #75: The Elimination Double Discard

This move is part of the Elimination Notes category



Nothing much to add to the TL;DR. If you trust that the player correctly handles double-discard situation, and they discard anyway, then they see the other copy somewhere. If you don't, you have it, but you can't know where yet.

Hanabi Technique of the day #76: The Early 5s Chop Move

TL;DR - If you have something better to do in the early game, yet perform a 5 stall on someone who sees you had something better, and the 5 is 1-away from chop, it should be understood as a 5 chop move, as if we were in the mid game



	
	
This move is part of the Chop Move category
	


In the mid-game, discarding is called a last-resort decision, because if you have pretty much anything better to do, you shouldn't do it. If you do it anyway, it can send important messages.

In the early-game, as we are trying to delay the first discard as much as possible, the 5 stalls are used as the last resort move when there is nothing better to do.

You should not perform a 5-stall if you have something to do (except sometimes on the very first turn, or if there is just one play left to do and you want to leave the chance to finesse or bluff to someone else).

When you are in a position where you shouldn't 5-stall, then it flows logically that you can still do other plays that involve 5s. It is just like if you were in the mid-game (where you can't 5-stall). This includes doing 5s Chop Move (Cluing a 5 1-away from chop to save both the 5 and the chop)

The trick is, whatever good move you had available must be visible to the person you are cluing, because they need to understand that it isn't a 5-stall.

Bonus: Anyone else, when the chop-move is demonstrated, if they didn't see anything good to do back then, can take elimination notes that they had at least one playable or saveable card back then.

    Hanabi Technique of the day #77: The 5 Pull

TL;DR - If you have something better to do in the early game, yet perform a 5 stall on someone who sees you had something better, and it is neither a save nor a chop move, it means to blind play the newest card (from the cards that are older than the 5) as a delayed play clue

The reasons why 5 stalls are allowed in the early game is because it is extremely unlikely to get a shuffle where a 5 becomes playable in the early game. So unlikely that it is more efficient to assume they never are playable to leave room for more useful strategies.

For the same reasons as the Early 5s Chop Move, you don't perform a 5-stall when you have something better to do. Therefore if you do clue a 5, it must be more important than a simple stall.

If the 5 is on chop, it is obviously a save clue.

If the 5 is one-away from chop, it is an early 5s chop move.

If the 5 is in any other position, there was no danger, so it must be a play clue. Yet the 5 is assumed to never be playable in the early game. This only leaves the option that this is a play clue on something else.

Imagine a player has green5, green2, yellow2 and red1. Red1 is clued, green2 is playable, yellow2 isn't. You can't efficiently get someone to play green2. But if someone clued the 5, now green2 would be easily focusable. This is the implied meaning for a 5 pull. It is clued, to get another card to become cluable through correct focus.

The further from the 5 the playable card would be, the easier it would be to wait for it to reach the chop, so it is also assumed that the playable card is right next to it (best value). Therefore, when a 5 pull happen, you don't need the second clue at all. The player should take it as a delayed play clue on the card next to it.

Now, once this technique becomes used, we quickly realise that even if the playable card was clueable, it is better to pre-emptively touch the 5 (saved for later) and get the card played, than to clue the card directly. Therefore 5-pulls are better than play clues, the same way bluffs are better than play clues. This means you can perform a 5-pull on any playable card, even if it is not related to the clued 5 at all. (And, of course, the player shouldn't assume the 5 is the same color as the played card, even if the played card was a 4).

5 Pulls should be treated as delayed play clues on everything already touched, so should be delayed until everything that was touched before and playable is played, since the blind play could be anything following up.

Long-form statement to figure out the blind play: The newest unclued card that is older than the newest new 5 touched by the 5-clue is being pulled.

ex: 5, A, 5, B, C (chop is on the right) is a 5-pull on A.

If the 5 is one-away from chop, it is an early 5s chop move.

If the 5 is in any other position, there was no danger, so it must be a play clue. Yet the 5 is assumed to never be playable in the early game. This only leaves the option that this is a play clue on something else.

Imagine a player has green5, green2, yellow2 and red1. Red1 is clued, green2 is playable, yellow2 isn't. You can't efficiently get someone to play green2. But if someone clued the 5, now green2 would be easily focusable. This is the implied meaning for a 5 pull. It is clued, to get another card to become cluable through correct focus.

The further from the 5 the playable card would be, the easier it would be to wait for it to reach the chop, so it is also assumed that the playable card is right next to it (best value). Therefore, when a 5 pull happen, you don't need the second clue at all. The player should take it as a delayed play clue on the card next to it.

Now, once this technique becomes used, we quickly realise that even if the playable card was clueable, it is better to pre-emptively touch the 5 (saved for later) and get the card played, than to clue the card directly. Therefore 5-pulls are better than play clues, the same way bluffs are better than play clues. This means you can perform a 5-pull on any playable card, even if it is not related to the clued 5 at all. (And, of course, the player shouldn't assume the 5 is the same color as the played card, even if the played card was a 4).

5 Pulls should be treated as delayed play clues on everything already touched, so should be delayed until everything that was touched before and playable is played, since the blind play could be anything following up.

Long-form statement to figure out the blind play: The newest unclued card that is older than the newest new 5 touched by the 5-clue is being pulled.

ex: 5, A, 5, B, C (chop is on the right) is a 5-pull on A.

Hanabi Technique of the day #78: 5 Clues in the early game FlowChart

Here's a handy flowchart for when a 5-clue is given during the early game



When the early game is over, the flowchart looks very similar, except that 5-stall and 5-pull are replaced with the simple "this is a play clue on the focused 5), except in situations like double-discard, where they turn back into 5-stalls

    Hanabi Technique of the day #79: The 5 Pull Prompt and 5 Pull Finesse

TL;DR - 5 Pulls can initiate a finesse or a prompt, even layered, as long as all concerned parties have the necessary information to identify the 5 Pull

When you perform a 5-pull, it is considered as a delayed Play clue that comes after everything else that was expected to get played from the previously available information. Since everyone else can see the card about to get pulled, anyone who can tell it's a 5-pull can be prompted or finessed by it.

It is important to note that if the "better" move available that turned the 5-stall into a 5-pull is unique and in someone's hand, that person doesn't know it's a 5-pull until the target plays, and can't be expected to play into the prompt or finesse.

5-pull finesses are special. Usually, reverse finesses are considered equal to normal finesses, and treated the exact same way. When it comes to a 5-pull finesse, it cannot be reversed. The player received it already has to wait for all currently known play clues to be resolved, he will not wait an extra turn to play, because it is important to demonstrate it asap.

When the pull finesse is given, you should analyze how many turns it will take until they can play. You can finesse any card that can be played before then, but not after.

For example, if no cards are clued anywhere, A gives a 5-pull to C to finesse B, it is fine, but giving it to finesse D is not fine, as C will misplay before D can respond to the finesse. On the other hand, if B already has two clued 1s, you expect C to have to wait at least one entire turn for them to play, so you can finesse D.


Once a blind play happened because of the 5-pull, the pulled player should expect his card to be related, and if more cards of that color already were in playable spots at the time of the clue, he should give them the necessary time to continue the layers just in case.

    Hanabi Technique of the day #80: The 5 Pull Promise

TL;DR - 5 Pulls can be followed up with a play clue that "locks" the identity of the pulled card into something needed for the play to work, but then the 5-pulled player can start playing right away and is promised it will work


When you receive a 5-pull, you are supposed to look around for all the cards that are already known to be playable, and wait for all of them to be played (This includes cards known to be playable in your own hand) before responding to the 5-pull. Since you don't know what it is, it can never be somethig layered, because you will just assume that whatever you play first is what was expected.

If you are waiting to play on a pull, and someone performs what seems like a finesse on you, you should assume that your pulled card is the missing card. This means that you can now play it as soon as the missing card is playable, instead of waiting for as long as originally planned.

If it turns out that the pulled card is not the missing card, then you can start blind playing from whatever card was on your finesse position at the time of the clue. This can never be a bluff, as it is not resolved instantly and wouldn't get a new card played anyway.

If you do a layered finesse on a 5-pulled player (finesse a card, but he will play the pulled card first, just like in a prompt+finesse), you have to make sure that them attempting to play the pulled card early will work. This can lead to a tempo gain (earlier play of an unrelated card), which is very good especially in the early game.

Hanabi Technique of the day #81: The Certain Finesse

TL;DR - You shouldn't do layered finesses on cards that you may have in your hand already, because if you do, the person will discard instead of playing. If you do a finesse on a card you may have, you promise it isn't layered and the possible discard is safe.

Sometimes you have a maybe-playable card, but you see a good move (finesse) to be done with the same card somewhere else. You can do it, expecting that if you have the same card, the other player will discard, and if they play, you don't have it.

In this scenario, you may force them to discard instead of playing, so you have to make sure the finesse isn't layered (because then they would discard an unrelated valuable card!)

Whenever you perform a finesse on a card you may have, you are performing a Certain Finesse, where instead of promising that the card is playable from newest side, you promise the card's exact position on newest slot, to allow them to discard precisely the correc card if needed.

On the other hand, if you are in Bluff Seat, you cannot perform a certain finesse, because the player can't know if it is a bluff. Since you cannot perform a certain finesse, and you obviously cannot perform a normal finesse (because you may duplicate), if you ever do a play that looks like it, it has to be a bluff to be legal, so it qualifies as a known bluff (the bluffed player knows it has to be a bluff).

The fact that the player plays into your known bluff still tells you nothing about your own card (maybe it's the playable card, maybe it's not).

    Hanabi Technique of the day #82: Finesses while 5 pulled

TL;DR - Any finesse performed by a player while he is 5-pulled should be treated a certain finesse, to avoid the risk of duplication

If you are currently 5-pulled, often you can't play right away, and you might see a chance to do a finesse yourself. Since you have a playable card, there a risk of duplication.

Any finesse you do should be a certain finesse, so that in case of duplication, the target can just throw it away.

If they do, it locks the identity ofthe pulled card into what was thrown, and you can play it before waiting for everything else.

Hanabi Technique of the day #83: The 5 Pull Skip

TL;DR - If you get 5 pulled, but the card that would seemingly be pulled is already "gotten", skip it and pull the next one.

This one may sounds obvious, but I want to document it anyway.

If you get 5-pulled, it is like a play clue on the target card. If the target card is already clued in any way (even if it's a collateral), skip it and go to the next card over (repeat until you find an unknown card).
This is because the main reason for the 5 pull is to get this card focusable or bluffable (and once you know this is why it was done, you can play it without actually needing that bluff or focused clue). Neither of those things make sense if the card is already clued anyway, so it would be the next one.

The same applies to a card that was "gotten" without a clue. For example, it was already finessed and expected to get played, the pulled card is the next one.

It is important to note than even though the next one is pulled, you still have to play in the order you received those clues/finesses/pulls. There is aways a possibility that the pulled card depends on the finessed card, or even more sneaky, that the finesse was layered and the pulled card depends on one of the layered cards.

When you get pulled and skip a finesse, you do not assume 100% which card is pulled. You just take note that "one card after the end of the finesse is also playable and just got pulled". Only when you play in the finesse will you know which card this actually is, because if the finesse is layered, maybe the pulled card was 2 or 3 away from the 5.

Hanabi Technique of the day #84: The Wrong Prompt (Mistake)

TL;DR If you get prompted, play the card, and it is not what you thought it would be (mistake), it is very likely that the player intended you to play your finesse position and didn't realize it would be a prompt.



	
This move is a mistake. It should never be performed on purpose, and defining it only helps recover from it when someone does it by accident.


Check out HTotD #10 and #11 for definitions of Prompts and Finesses

This move is a mistake, but it is a mistake that is both extremely common, and extremely easy to identify and recover from, so it is worth mentioning.

Ex: B has a known white card. White1 is already played. A clues "white" to C's white 3. This means B can play the two (or the three wouldn't be playable). Since B has a known white card, this is a prompt and he should play it. He plays, it was a 4 (the team loses a life). Everyone understands that A was planning on getting them to play their newest card (the real white2), and didn't realize his move would look like a prompt.

C waits one more turn to play, and B tries to play what was their finesse position then. The mistake costed the team one life, but the team recovered the efficiency at least.

Possible prompts take priority over finesse interpretation, but itis easy for a clue giver to not realize their move can be interpreted as a prompt. We assume when they make such a mistake, that they missed the prompt interpretation and intended for a finesse.

    Hanabi Technique of the day #85: Critical Discard after a Chop Move (Mistake)

TL;DR - If you discard a critical card and you were chop moved, undo the chop move.



	
	
This move is a mistake. It should never be performed on purpose, and defining it only helps recover from it when someone does it by accident.
	


When you get chop moved, your chop moves. The card that was your chop is considered saved even though it wasn't clued, and your next oldest unclued card becomes your chop.

You can get chop moved multiple times, each time your chop moves by one slot.

If you are currently chop moved at least once (so your chop is not your oldest unclued card), you should expect everyone to be aware of that. Chop moves are usually globally known. This means that, if you have a critical on your current chop, they will save it, because they know exactly where you chop actually is (provided they have been paying attention, which you should trust them to do)

If you discard, and it was a critical, it is quite obvious that a mistake happened. The team didn't save the card. Since the idea of saving criticals is a much lower-level idea than chop moves, it is pretty safe to assume that what happened is not that someone forgot to save your chop, but that someone had a wrong idea of where your chop was. Or, at the very least, they didn't think it was where you thought it was.

Furthermore, the team let you discard in this situation, thinking your chop was not where you thought it was. This means that the other possibility for the chop is actually not critical, and they were fine with you discarding it.

In this scenario, you should assume that the chop move was the mistake that led to this discard. Either the chop move was not globally known, or it wasn't intended at all and was given as a mistake, or it wasn't a chop move and you mistakenly thought it was. Either way, you should undo one level of chop move after this misplay happens.

    Hanabi Technique of the day #86: Duplication Responsibility

TL;DR - Let the person who is the least likely to duplicate save 2s on chop, to reduce the risk of duplication.

Usually, when giving out a save clue, duplication is impossible. If the card is to be saved, then it is the last copy, so of course nobody else has it. For example, even if you have an unknown 3 clued, you can save a critical 3 on chop, because it's logically not the same.

There is one exception to that, which are 2s. You are allowed to (and should) save 2s on chop even if it's the first one seen, because there is a chance that the other copy is so far in the deck that, if you lose the first one, you lose the game.

This means that, sometimes, you will be put in a situation where a two looks like it should be saved, but there is a chance that you have the other copy in your clued cards.

If you see another player has it in their clued cards, then you don't need to save it at all, so even though the save would be safe for you to perform, you simply don't want it performed at all.

If you don't see anyone else who has it, but you could have it, then you want to save it, but you can't because it is risky.

In this situation, you should leave the save responsibility to anyone who doesn't have any matching clued cards. (and If they choose not to, elimination notes!)

If there is no such person, the responsibility goes to the person with the fewest matching clued cards.

In case of a tie, the player who has the more specific clues on those cards should do it (including globally known elimination notes)

If there is still a tie, either player can do it, and it will depend if the first of them has something better to do on his turn.

Chop moves are included in "clued cards that could be another copy of the 2", but are very unspecific "matching" cards.

Hanabi Technique of the day #87: Focus Inversion from Elimination Notes

TL;DR - If the team clearly demonstrates that there is nothing to clue, and then, without drawing a new card, they give you a seemingly useful clue, invert its focus because if they couldn't give it the first time, the focus must be wrong.



	
This move is part of the Elimination Notes category



Sometimes, someone will have a playable card which can't be focused properly with a clue. In this case, you will usually have to wait until either the other copy is picked up, the card can be played indirectly (ex: layered finesse), or the person discards enough for the playable card to reach the chop.

While waiting for one of those events, you may reach a point where there is nothing else to clue, and discard. Since discarding is a last resort, when you do so, if you had available clues, everyone should be taking elimination notes "I have nothing cluable".

After this discard happens, and you know the specified player now knows he had nothing cluable, you can proceed to clue him his playable card and other card with a common characteristic. Technically, the other card would be the focus, but now that the team has demonstrated "Your hand has nothing cluable", the player can know that the focus is not actually important right now (therefore, it is not the focus!).

The player should interpret a clue when the focus is so clearly contradictory with his eliminations notes as an inverted focus clue. He should see the "normal" focus as collateral (as if the card was already clued, not a newly clued card), and calculated the next focus from there.

    Hanabi Technique of the day #88: Distribution Clue

TL;DR - When the end game is reached, you can duplicate a card if the first holder knows its exact identity and location, to better distribute playable cards around the table

Usually, we try not to duplicate cards. If someone has a known card, we ignore the other copy, and even treat is as trash.

Sometimes, you will reach the endgame, and realize our plays are very poorly balanced (HTotD #26). One person may have more plays than they should, and you either know or strongly suspect that this will cost the win.

If one of the cards that they have as playable is precisely known (clued, certain prompt, certain finesse, etc), ths means that, in the event of a duplication, no mistake will happen. They will simply discard or even ignore their copy.

If you see the other copy of such a card in another hand, you want to calculate of tempo would be better if that other person played it instead. If so, you are allowed to duplicate by giving a Distribution clue to the other person. Everyone will understand that you calculated it was better this way (and for those who don't know why, trust you).

Exercise for the reader: This technique sacrifies efficiency for the sake of tempo, because a clue is used to clue a card that wasn't needed (0 cards for 1 clue) How to take this technique to the next level and get some actual efficiency out of it, while still keeping the tempo gain?
