# Sacrifices

## Introduction

A sacrifice is a strategy where the team willingly loses one life for the sake of efficiency or tempo

Considering that the final score does not take into account the number of lost lives, it is logical that the team can afford to lose the first two lives to get an advantage otherwise. As long as the third life is not lost, the team can still get the max score.

Since lives are both limited and non-renewable, when the team often loses the game due to making too many mistakes that end in misplays, that team should not use sacrifices

Here is a list of all moves that sacrifice a life and are worth using up the first two lives for.

Obviously, all those strategies become unusable as soon as the team reaches their last life.
