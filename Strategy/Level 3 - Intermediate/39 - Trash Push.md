# Trash Push

<br />

## Technique

As mentioned by [Good Touch Principle](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%201%20-%20First%20Principles/2%20-%20The%20Good%20Touch%20Principle.md), trash cards should not be clued, if possible. Furthermore, a clue that only touches trash card would be a very bad clue, unless it has a special meaning.

As mentioned in [Trash Chop Move](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/23%20-%20Trash%20Chop%20Move.md), if you clue only known trash cards that are not on chop, it must be because you want them to be discarded, instead of the chop, therefore the chop must be saved right now. It is possible that not only the chop should be saved, but also the cards next to it. You should chop move all the cards older than the oldest trash touched, when receiving such a clue.

As mentioned in [Trash Plays](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/37%20-%20Trash%20Plays.md), if you clue trash cards that are not known as such, no matter where, you are finessing all the cards that could fit this clue that are remaining to play, in other people's hands. For example, a newly picked up 5. You can also bluff this way.

Now, sometimes, you want to clue a card that is not on chop right now. The draw was unlucky, and there is no clue that gets the focus you want, but it is extremely important to play that card asap, as opposed to waiting until it reaches the chop. You cannot afford the tempo loss from waiting.

In that case, you can clue the person's current chop. Then, after the clue, the card you want is the new chop, and another person can do a clue that focuses it to get the card played. For this to work, the first clue needs to be obviously trash, otherwise there is a risk the person will attempt to play it or save it for later and make wron assumptions. 

Once you have given a clue that is obviously trash, and it is on chop, the receiver might wonder why you would give him a trash clue here. He can understand, by himself, that you were attempting to change which card was their chop, to be able to focus a playable card properly, for tempo reasons, so that somebody else can clue it. This means that nobody actually needs to give the second clue, as the receiver can deduce that by himself.

Since the only explanation is that you wanted to move the chop to a playable card, the person knows without the second clue that their new chop is a playable card.

## Note

You can also move their chop by giving a save clue or play clue on the current chop, if it isn't trash. But if the clue is not obviously trash, the person can't figure out by themselves that this is anything more than the play/save itself (because we give those clues all the time without trying to move the chop), so in this case, somebody actually needs to spend the second clue. It's not inherently bad, but it's not the Trash Push technique, it's just 2 independent clues.
