# Double Discard

<br />

## Technique

If somebody discards a semi-critical, it is possible the other copy of that card is on the next person's chop, and nobody had time to save it. This person should not discard on this turn, unless they can see it somewhere, just in case.

When you are in "double discard position", which means you're not allowed to discard on this turn, you are allowed, if necessary, to give a low-value clue, or if absolutely necessary, a zero-value clue. It is obviously better to play or give a good clue.

Double Discard position was mentioned briefly in [Minimum Clue Value](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/27%20-%20Minimum%20Clue%20Value.md), 

Double Discard position is really bad for tempo and optimization of clues, but there is no real solution to that. The more skilled a group becomes, the fewer semi-critical discards will be done, therefore this situation will become rarer.

## Bonus Technique

If you see somebody discard even though they are in double discard situation, and you have reasonable [trust](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/34%20-%20Trust%20Level.md), you can assume the other copy of the card is visible. As always, if you don't see it, you have it. The player is NOT promising that it is playable, but once enough information comes your way, you might be able to figure out where the card is without an extra clue.

Furthermore, if they do discard, when in double discard situation, even though you know for a fact that there was a good value clue they could do, and there was no reason to discard (generation discard, scream discard, etc), this is a finesse double discard, where they tell the person who has the other copy that it is playable right now, therefore on newest card position (or on a clued card, if prompt is possible). Logically, you can do bluff double discards this way too.

	* If two people have the card you want to finesse, and the second one has high trust for the first one, you can do your finesse. The fact that the first doesn't play should be enough to make the other understand what is going on.

	* Point to a trash card in someone's hand as if you were giving a play clue, so that the person who has the real copy of the card plays it to prevent the misplay. This can be used as a prompt, finesse or even bluff.
