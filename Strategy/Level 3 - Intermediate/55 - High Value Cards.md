# High Value Cards

<br />

## Technique

In Hanabi, cards have circumstancial value, and it is important to be aware of it. Discarding should be done on the lowest-value card we have available, if possible. Of course, having a chop means you very rarely choose which card you discard. But in many cases, you can choose between discarding, or letting the person after you discard, and you should be aware that the previous players also made that choice.

This means that you can have a rough evaluation of the value of your chop after a while.

While save clues can be given on critical cards, there are many other ways to save cards that can be done on any cards, and should be used on high value cards whenever possible. An entire category of moves (chop moves) is based on saving unknown cards like that.

In order:

* Critical cards: Highest value of all. Losing one of those instantly makes victory impossible. Should be saved at all costs, including using save clues.

* Playable cards: Any card that is playable, where playable includes a card that can't be played now, but we have in our hands everything needed to make it playable, therefore we can have a good estimate of when it will be played, as opposed to if a required card was still in the deck. Very High value, losing them equals a potentially big loss of tempo. I you discard one and people had a chance to save it (but didn't), you can assume that the other copy is somewhere. Giving a play clue on it is the preferred method of saving it.

* 1-away cards: Cards that only miss one thing to become playable, and will most likely be playable soon. High value, should be chop moved if you don't have both copies. Primary targets for bluffs, because it allows a very efficient save.

* 3s: Also high value, [3-bluffs](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/38%20-%203%20Bluff.md) literally only exists to allow more chances to save them. Same value as 1-away cards

* 2-away cards: Medium value, estimated to be playable in the medium to long term. Can be chop moved if there is nothing better to do, but most of the time it is not worth it. You are likely to find the other copy before it becomes playable anyway. Can be saved through double-bluffs or similar techniques if you get the chance

* Trash cards -> The other copy is played, so we don't need it at all. Is only useful for giving known trash in some cases and being discarded. Low value, should never be saved in any way.
