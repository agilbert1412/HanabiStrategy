# Positional Discard

<br />

## Technique

Most of the time, our hand is incertain. You don't know all the cards, or even most of them. The whole point of having [a chop](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%201%20-%20First%20Principles/1%20-%20The%20Chop.md) is that you know which card is more likely to be trash (and can be saved if not).

But sometimes, in some very specific cases, you may know that your entire hand is trash cards. For example, near the end of the game, there will come a point where all the useful cards are drawn. If you have none of them, then you see all of them, so you can know you only have trash.

Usually, this will only happen during the endgame, but sometimes it may happen slightly earlier. Now two things can happen. Either the team has plenty of clues, and you can just do your best to win the endgame with those, or your team can have clue issues which means that either you have no clues, or you have few clues and you are aware that there is a risk you run out of them.

In the second case, you should start doing positional discards. Every time your turn comes, if you have enough tempo to afford it, you can discard instead of giving a clue. You choose a card that you want to clue, check what slot it's on (1-2-3-4-5, starting from newest), and discard the same slot in your own hand. This tells everyone "somebody can play the card on this specific slot". If there was only one person, then as always, the only one who doesn't see such a playable card knows they have it.

If there are several players with a playable card on this slot, it's slightly more complicated. First of all, eliminate those who already knew about the card, since the discard was intended as a useful message. Then, eliminate those who have something else to play this round, since the discard used up tempo, so must be giving someone something to do this round. Then, out of all the remaining potential targets, you have to expect that the last one to get a turn will play. The first one will not, because they see the card, and the second one, seeing that the positional discard was ignored, should understand that there were multiple targets, and play.

This move is powerful, because it lets you clue something even when the team has zero clues, while gaining a new clue. Furthermore, during the last turn (after the last card is drawn), tempo is irrelevant, so it can always be used.

This move is also dangerous. You are near the end of the game, you have no cards to play and never will, yet you consume tempo. Make sure you count correctly and are 100% certain that you drawing a card on this turn instead of using a clue will not screw over somebody. If you do have zero clues, then don't hesitate to do it, because you were going to draw a card regardless.

The vast majority of positional discards will be done during the last turn around the table, because all cards are visible and discards are not risky at this point. It is possible to do them earlier, just be aware of the risks and pre-conditions.
