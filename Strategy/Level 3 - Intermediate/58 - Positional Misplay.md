# Positional Misplay

<br />

## Technique
	
The Positional Misplay is one of many types of [Sacrifices](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Categories/Sacrifices.md)

You can perform [Positional Discards](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/30%20-%20Positional%20Discard.md) when two conditions are met: You know that your entire hand is trash, and discarding will not lose critical tempo.

Usually, this happens in the end game, or very close to it. Once all the cards are found, it is easy to figure out if you have none of them (you see all of them). Furthermore, after the last card is drawn, tempo loss will be irrelevant.

But sometimes, you can match condition 1 before then. As soon as you see all useful cards, you know that both your hand and the remaining deck contains none. That can happen way before the endgame.

The problem is that, when it happens, you know your hand is trash, but any player who holds a useful card can't know yet that this stage has been reached.

If you perform a positional discard at that stage, it can still be understood except in one case: you discard the chop. Discarding the chop, to the eyes of someone who doesn't see all useful cards, is no different from a normal discard. They can't understand that as a positional discard on someone's chop position.

In this case, you need to make the message clearer. One way to do that is with a positional misplay. Instead of discarding your chop, misplay it. You will communicate the same message, but this time it doesn't look like a "nothing special" move, so it is very obvious to the target that this is intended as a positional information.

Furthermore, this communicates to everyone that all useful cards are visible, which may or may not turn our to be valuable information.

	* When you realize that you are part of an ambiguous finesse, you can either respond to it by playing, or keep ignoring it to pass back the burden of playing to the other person implicated. Do this if you have a good reason to prefer that they respond to it instead of you.

	* When in a position to do a positional discard that would be understood by itself, you can misplay instead to send the message harder, which will signal that two players can play that specific slot
