# Double Bluff

<br />

## Technique

### Not to be confused with [Double Half Bluff](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/29%20-%20Double%20Half%20Bluff.md)

The definition of X-away card is a card that requires X cards of the same color to be played, to become playable. For example, if the yellow1 is played, the yellow2 is playable, yellow3 is 1-away, yellow4 is 2-away, etc.

In a [Bluff](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/15%20-%20The%20Bluff.md), you clue a 1-away card, to get an unrelated card played by the person on your left, because they think it is the missing card.

In a [Double Half Bluff](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/29%20-%20Double%20Half%20Bluff.md), you clue a 2-away card when someone has the first missing card, and the person on their left has an unrelated playable card that they will play, believing it is the second missing card.

In a Triple Two-Thirds Bluff, you clue a 3-away card, to get the first two missing cards played, and an unrelated card bluffed afterwards.

In a [3 Bluff](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/38%20-%203%20Bluff.md), you clue a 3, regardless of what its X-away value is, to get an unrelated card played (This is a [Convention](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Conventions.md))

In a double bluff, you can clue a card that is 2-away, so that the two players playing right after you blind play unrelated cards. The expected cards are not available anywhere to play.

The idea is that if you clue a 2-away card, everyone knows we need to play two cards to get it played. Regardless of the interpretation used, we try to keep expectations consistent. Everyone expects two cards to get played. In the case of a [Finesse](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/11%20-%20The%20Finesse.md), it happens normally. In the case of the [Double Half Bluff](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/29%20-%20Double%20Half%20Bluff.md), two cards also get played, but one of them is unrelated. So in the case of a Double Bluff, we also want two cards to get played. Since normal bluffs are only allowed with 1-away cards, it is also consistent with this logic that a 2-away card would not be a normal bluff.

So when performing a Double Bluff, everyone, seeing none of the cards, expects to play both of them. The player on your left plays one and it turns out to be unrelated (and doesn't match the clue!). Everyone understands that it is a bluff, but if things go on like this, the player who received the clue, thinking the card is 1-away, will eventually misplay. The team needs to tell him that the card was 2-away instead. The way to do that is by playing a second card. The very next player (on the left of the player on your left, or 2 seats from you) also blind plays, but fully aware this will be a bluff and the card will be unrelated.

The X-away value of the card determines how many people must blind play, and the number of people who blind play tell the clue receiver the X-away value of his clued card, therefore he knows it's exact identity.

You can also do triple and quadruple bluffs, technically, if are lucky enough.

Double bluffs requires the first person to trust you with layered finesses, and the second person to have very high trust that you master all previous forms of bluff. Do not attempt double bluffs yet if you have a history of messing up simpler bluffs, because the move relies heavily on trust.

## Example

For example: You clue "red" on red4, while only red1 is played. The player on your left believes they have red2 and red3, so they play their finesse. It works, but is not red2. Now the next player, from context, can understand they don't have red2, and that it was a bluff. But since they trust that you only give good bluffs, and that bluff was neither an incomplete bluff, a 1-away bluff, or a 3-bluff, they can understand that it was a double bluff, and also blind-play, knowingly, an unrelated card.
