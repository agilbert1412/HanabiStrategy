# Lie Component

<br />

## Technique

Player2 has a yellow 2 somewhere

Player3 has : r1, r2, b1, g5, y1

Now you might be thinking "if only that g5 wasn't here, I could do a great 5 for 1 finesse! Now I'll have to clue y1 directly instead..."

But you shouldn't. You see g5 one-away from chop and no green cards are played yet. You know 99.999% that this g5 will require a save clue at some point before becoming playable. Therefore, it will cost the same number of clues to save it later, or to fix it before the finesse makes it misplayed.

You can do the finesse. Clue y2. Player3 will play r1. Since you can't bluff him, he'll keep going. He will play r1, r2, b1, and when he's about to misplay g5, fix it by telling him "actually, that is a 5".

Lie components work on the basis of promises. If you finesse something, you promise someone that they can play the required card. In the case of a bluff, this is a hard lie, because the card doesn't actually exist. But in the case of a lie component, it is a soft lie. You promised the card was playable, which is true, and you implied that it will get found without an extra clue, which was not true. Still, you wanted them to look for it, to play more free cards.

A lie component can be done on anyone, because it is fairly easy to identify for everyone else. But a lie component requires a fix later, and the fix must be given by the person who did the original clue. This is because in some cases, it's not actually a lie component, and instead someone else can play what's missing for the layers to become playable, so no fix will be given. It is impossible, as a third player, to tell if it is a lie component that requires fixing or a layered finesse that requires them to play, so they can't fix it.

If you give the lie, you must fix it. You must make sure before giving it that you will be able to fix it when the time comes, and you must not fix it pre-emptively.

When you fix it, you have two options. Either you fix by telling them where the real card they are looking for is, or you fix by telling them the cards in between are not what they think they are.

If the unplayable cards are trash, or there are more than one and can't be touched with one clue, you should clue the real card (in the example, yellow). If there is exactly one unplayable card, or several with a common characteristic you can clue, and you want to save it/them for later, you should touch that card instead as the fix, saying "skip over those when you keep looking", and they shall be considered saved for later.

You should wait until the turn right before the mistake happens to give the fix, because all cards between the real expected card and the last played card will not be played after fixing, so let them play them before fixing.

Analyze the situation beforehand. Make sure doing the lie component finesse is worth it, including the cost of the fix. Often, it is.
