# Repeat Fix Clue

<br />

## Technique

Sometimes, someone will be 100% convinced that their card is something in particular, and be wrong. Someone has to give them a fix clue when the time comes for them to misplay it, to save a life, the card, or both.

Any clue that "changes" what they believe will be taken as a fix clue.

But sometimes, you cannot change what they think. For example, they have a clued "green" card, green4, that they believe is green3, and you can't reasonably give "4" without duplicating, touching trash, or something.

Now if this is their only green card, they know that you know that they are about to play it, and you clue "green" again on it, the clue will seem totally, 100%, useless. Now of course, if they have low trust for you, they might just say "I already knew that", roll their eyes, and misplay anyway. But if you never make that kind of mistake, and therefore they can trust you, they should understand that this means "what you currently think, is actually wrong"

Now that you understand "this was actually wrong", you know two things: This is not green three, and this is a useful green. Therefore, you know it's either 4 or 5, and as soon as you know which through context, you can play it when it's playable.

If it happens that there are no more useful cards that match the clue but are not what you thought, then your card is officially trash, and you can throw it. Basically, Good Touch Principle (HTotD #2) takes precedence, so you still assume it's non-trash if possible, but if not, then it must be trash.

Pretty much most interpretations take priority over repeat fix clues, because there are many reasons why somebody would clue a known card again. Only if all of those reasons don't apply (play clue, finesse, tempo clue, etc) can you understand it as a repeat fix clue.

	* Recluing something that was finessed is called a finesse stomp. With beginners, it is usually a mistake as the person didn't see that it was finessed, but with experienced players, it's a more subtle type of repeat fix clue.
