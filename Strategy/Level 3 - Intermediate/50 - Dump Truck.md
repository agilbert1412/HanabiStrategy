# The Dump Truck

<br />

## Convention
	
The Dump Truck is one of many types of [Sacrifices](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Categories/Sacrifices.md)

During the early game, reasonably often, one player will have a hand that is entirely playable from newest to oldest. Of course, the in the ideal scenario, you can finesse their oldest card with something, therefore getting their entire hand + 1 cards played with a single clue, because of the deep layers.

But what if the next card is not available? This kind of move is so efficient that we can't afford to randomly clue some cards in the hand one at a time. That is the time to perform a Dump Truck.

If you blind play your chop, purposely sacrificing a life and an unknown card, it must mean that something extremely efficient is available right now. Every player looks at other hands, and if they can't see an entirely playable hand, it means they have one. The dump trucked player starts dumping his entire hand on the table from newest to oldest.

Performing a Dump Truck always sacrifices a life, so you have to consider if it's worth it with your current group. Furthermore, you sacrifice one card. To minimize that loss as much as possible, here are safeties measures when performing a dump truck.

* Only perform Dump Trucks in the early game. If the worst case scenario happens, and you lose a critical card (ex: a 5), you can just give up on that game and restart. Make sure your group is fine with that, if it happens. This will make the worst case scenario waste as little time as possible for your group.
* If you see a dump truck available, but not on the very next player, consider letting someone else do it (before the trucked player gets a turn, of course). If the last player (before the trucked player has a turn) has a 5 or 2 on chop, then the player before him should do it to prevent losing this card, and if they also have a 5 or 2, the previous player should do it, and so on. If you perform it, all players between you and the truck should consider themselves chop moved.

If you happen (very rare) to see two players that can be dump trucked, blind misplay your second oldest card instead of your oldest to signal "there are two trucks". Anyone who sees only one, knows they are the other one. This can technically be extended for the number of unclued cards/players there are. Blind misplay third oldest to signal 3 trucks, etc.

## Tempo Issues

While a dump truck is an extremely efficient move (4/5 cards played in exchange of one card lost and one life), it has very poor tempo. Since the value of tempo (relative to efficiency) grows over the course of the game, doing it in the beginning is not problematic.

Even with this, the tempo of such a move is so bad (one player having 3/5 cards to play means we need to consume 15-20 turns of tempo to get this done) that it must be done in the fastest possible way. This means that the dump trucked player MUST play every single turn he gets until the dump truck is over, and cannot delay even to do efficient clues. Furthermore, if any finesse component is present in the dump truck, they must resolve before they are needed, so that the dump trucked player doesn't need to wait for potential finesses and delay any of the plays. If one of the plays require waiting, the dump truck is invalid.
