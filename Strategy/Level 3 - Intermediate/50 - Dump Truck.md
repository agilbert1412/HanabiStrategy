# The Dump Truck

<br />

## Convention
	
This moves sacrifices a life for the sake of efficiency or tempo. It should not be used in games where the players often lose 2 or more lives to mistakes


During the early game, reasonably often, one player will have a hand that is entirely playable from newest to oldest. Of course, the in the ideal scenario, you can finesse their oldest card with something, therefore getting their entire hand + 1 cards played with a single clue, because of the deep layers.

But what if the next card is not available? This kind of move is so efficient that we can't afford to randomly clue some cards in the hand one at a time. That is the time to perform a Dump Truck.

If you blind play your chop, purposely sacrificing a life and an unknown card, it must mean that something extremely efficient is available right now. Every player looks at other hands, and if they can't see an entirely playable hand, it means they have one. The dump trucked player starts dumping his entire hand on the table from newest to oldest, completely ignoring all clues he already received

Performing a Dump Truck always sacrifices a life, so you have to consider if it's worth it with your current group. Furthermore, you sacrifice one card. To minimize that loss as much as possible, here are safeties measures when performing a dump truck.



	
Only perform Dump Trucks in the early game. If the worst case scenario happens, and you lose a critical card (ex: a 5), you can just screw that game and restart. Make sure your group is fine with that, if it happens. This will make the worst case scenario waste as little time as possible for your group.
	If you see a dump truck available, but not on the very next player, consider letting someone else do it (before the trucked player gets a turn, of course). If the last player (before the trucked player has a turn) has a 5 or 2 on chop, then the player before him should do it to prevent losing this card, and if they also have a 5 or 2, the previous player should do it, and so on. If you perform it, all players between you and the truck should consider themselves chop moved.

Lastly, if you happen (very rare) to see two players that can be dump trucked, blind misplay your second oldest card instead of your oldest to signal "there are two trucks". Anyone who sees only one, knows they are the other one. This can technically be extended for the number of unclued cards/players there are. Blind misplay third oldest to signal 3 trucks, etc.
