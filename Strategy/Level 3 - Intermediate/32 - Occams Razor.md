# Occam's Razor

<br />

## Technique

If you receive a clue that could be many things, the priority interpretation is the safest interpretation (ex: we assume save clue over play clue when possible). Otherwise, we try to give people the chance to disambiguate (ex: waiting one turn to see if someone blind plays, to see if the clue is a finesse or not).

If all else fails, and you still aren't sure, assume the simplest explanation is correct. For example, if you get clued a 3 and there are no 3s playable and no 2 on finesses, assume it's a self-finesse. If you get clued a 3 but there are 3s playable, don't assume it's a self-finesse, assume simple play clue.

Basically, don't overthink it.
