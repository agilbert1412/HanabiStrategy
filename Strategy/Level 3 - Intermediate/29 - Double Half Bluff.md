# Double Half Bluff

<br />

## Technique

###Not to be confused with [Double Bluff](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/45%20-%20Double%20Bluff.md)

When describing [the bluff](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/15%20-%20The%20Bluff.md), a special condition had to be true. You can only bluff the person who plays immediatly after yourself. The reason was explained: When bluffing, everyone thinks they have the required card, therefore your target must be the very first person who will get a chance to play it, since they would all attempt it. After this person plays, everyone understands that it was a bluff, etc.

In some specific conditions, you can do bluffs on someone who is not directly on your left, following the same logic.

In the case of a bluff, you would clue a card 1-away from playable, hard lie about the existence of the missing card to get someone to play something for free.
In some cases, you can clue a card that is two-away from playable, and the first missing card actually exists and is playable, but the second missing card is the lie. Now, everyone will think they have the second missing card, but since they all see the first one, they will all wait for it. This means that, even though they all want to play the second one, they aren't getting the chance until the first one is played.

In this case, the first person to get the chance will not be the player on your left. It's going to be the player on the left of whoever has the first missing card.

This is called a double half-bluff. Double because two cards are promised, but half because half of them are the lie (bluff), the other half is true.

Same logic happens after. Everyone sees that whoever got bluffed has played, understands what happened, the play is over. Whoever was clued knows the exact identity of their card.

Logically, you can also do triple two-thirds bluffs, and so on, following the same logic. Only One of the played card is the "fake" one, everyone that plays before must play a real card on the pile leading to the clued card.

## Examples

Order of players: A->B->C->D->E

You are: A

B has a playable green 1 on his finesse position

C has a playable red 1 on his finesse position

D has the green three anywhere.


If you clue the green 3 with "green", as a play clue, everyone will immediatly see that B has the 1. But no one will see the 2 anywhere, so everyone will think they have the 2. B thinks it's on the second newest card, C, D and E think they have it on finesse.

B will play his 1, expecting to play the 2 later.

C will attempt to play the 2, but end up playing a red 1 instead. Everyone, seeing that he played, understand that the green 2 is nowhere to be found and that this was a double half bluff. C could think it's a layered finesse and green 2 is on his next card, BUT, as explained in [the bluff technique](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/15%20-%20The%20Bluff.md), he sees that it could be a bluff, because in this situation, he was the "very next" player to get to play the 2, therefore he must assume it is a double half bluff. If it truly was a layered finesse, E could have given it instead to make it clear.

## WARNING

Do not attempt to do double half bluffs if you don't have a lot of experience with standard bluffs (both receiving and giving). If you have confidently given and responded to standard bluffs many times in the past, and have a very high success rate for those, then you can start looking at double half bluffs. Furthermore, they are likely to go wrong if any of the relevant players has trouble with normal bluff, so use your judgement.
