# Trust Level

<br />

## Technique

A Principle called [Trust Your Teammates](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%201%20-%20First%20Principles/6%20-%20Trust%20Your%20Team.md) was explained before. While this may seem to make sense on the surface, it actually doesn't hold when you start playing with a group of people with wildly different experience levels.

There should always be, at least, minimal trust. Which means that, if your team mate makes a move that could either be correct or a mistake, depending on your hand, you should assume you have what is needed or the move to be good. the reasoning is explained in the other strategy. Basically, if they do get it right, you have to act on it, and if they don't, it's going to be easier to see their own mistake if it causes a misplay, than if you act as if nothing happened.

That's minimal trust level.

For the higher trust levels, there isn't a pre-defined list of levels, because it is highly dependent on the group, how experienced the best players are, and how inexperienced the worst players are. Furthermore, it depends on the conventions used (irrelevant of strategies), the variant used, and if you are playing online or IRL.

Usually, the max trust level is assuming that every player is as good as the best one, and knows all of the same things as them. If you play with maximum trust, you can infer information not only from the moves made, but also from the moves not made. For example, you could guess that you don't have a specific card in your hand if, had you had it, a player could have done a finesse, yet they chose to do a weaker move. If you manage to act on this information, then another player could understand that they were finessable from it, and blind play, etc.

Higher trust level needs to actually be correlated with expectations, because the higher the trust is, the more misplays will happen if a trusted person doesn't play as well as expected.

Trust level is on a player basis. You can have high trust for someone, and low trust for someone else. In the extreme case, you may be doing [priority bluffs](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/20%20-%20Priority%20Plays.md) on a player, and not even attempt [finesses](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/11%20-%20The%20Finesse.md) on another.

Furthermore, you should usually give a player trust that is slightly higher than your actual expectations. This is because players will attempt to use new moves when they see the chance, and there is a first time for everything. When they attempt a move slightly above their own level, they should be trusted on it so that if they do it well, it works. This is literally the only way for them to improve.

If you don't trust them enough, they can't improve. But be careful, if you give them trust that is too high above their level, they will inadvertently cause misplays when they do acceptable but non-optimal moves and you "trust" that there is a deeper meaning. If you overestimate someone and misplay on their correct but not perfect moves, it's on you. As the more experienced player, it is your responsability to correctly assess the less experienced player's skill level and trust them appropriately. In many cases, this will be hard, and you may get it wrong. You definitely shouldn't blame an unexperienced player for playing lower than your trust level. You should have given them lower trust.

On the other hand, if you are the less experienced player, and you want higher trust to be able to make more impressive plays, then you have to convince your team that you are good enough.
