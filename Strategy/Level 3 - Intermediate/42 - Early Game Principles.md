# Early Game Principles

<br />

## Technique

It is sometimes hard to figure out what to do in the first few turns of the early game. Here are a few things you should consider. There is no order for what is better or worse, because it is all highly circumstancial. Judge for yourself, with what you know of the table, what is better for a given turn.

* High efficiency plays: How many cards can you get played with one clue? Can you get a card played and a card saved for later with a bluff?

* High Tempo plays: Get the player right next to you to play something right away, especially if you see the follow-up cards already available.

* Responsibility plays: You see a great play, but the player right after you could also do it. Can you let him do it? Are the cards placed in such a way that maybe your hand allows him to do even better?

* Dead-End Plays: Even if you have playable cards, if they lead to nothing as far as you know, make sure you think about what clues you could give. It's better to give a good clue than to play a dead-end card, but it's better to play any card than to give a clue that someone who has no playable cards could give themselves.

* Planning for 5 stalls: Which 5s can be used for stalling? Is there anyone who doesn't see a 5 anywhere? Are they at risk of killing the early game? Can you make sure they have something to do?

* Letting people do bluffs: Bluffs are great in the early game. If you can get a card played, but maybe someone else can bluff it, maybe let them have the chance? In the early game, most of the time, bluffs are superior to finesses, which means that even if you can finesse a card by cluing the follow-up, you might prefer to bluff it with something unrelated, and get the follow-up later with a different clue.

* Prioritizing non-finessable cards: If you can't do a finesse or a bluff, and must clue something the boring way, choose something as far from newest card as possible, because it is the most unlikely to be finessable by someone else.

* Keep ambiguity low: If you can get someone to play something by being sure of what it is, it is much better, because they still have the options of doing good clues themselves instead of playing if they have the chance. If you clue "1s" to somebody, he can't know which is which until all are played, and therefore may have to give up on good finesses because he doesn't know if he would duplicate the 1.

	* Save clues are bad for efficiency and for tempo, and should only be given when they are needed or there is nothing better to do. If you do have something better to do, but choose to give a clue that looks like an unneeded save clue, it means it isn't one and is actually a play clue.

	* If your entire hand is clued, the other players must leave you clues, and you must use them even for low-value clues. If they don't leave you a clue, it means you can play something.
