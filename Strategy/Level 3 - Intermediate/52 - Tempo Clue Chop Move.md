# Tempo Clue Chop Move

<br />

## Technique

The Trash Chop Move is one of many types of [Chop Moves](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Categories/Chop%20Moves.md).

[Tempo Clues](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/28%20-%20Tempo%20Clue.md) can have many different meanings, but it always comes down to the question of how valuable was the gained tempo, and was it worth it. If your analysis brings you to the answer "no", it means there is a part of the clue you don't see.

Since tempo clues are allowed in low-value situations, if the player was in one and had nothing obviously better to do, then of course you can't take for granted that there is a deeper meaning.

But if they chose this clue, even with the low-value, that means there is something more. The only person who can't see that "more" thing must have it, as always.

If you received the clue, and can't see the "more" thing, and there was a reasonable risk of you discarding on this turn, you can easily deduce that they did it to get you to play instead of discarding. You should consider it a chop move, and consider your current chop "saved" with no clues. The next card is now your real chop.
