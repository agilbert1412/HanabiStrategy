# Information Priority

<br />

## Technique

Most of the time, in Hanabi, when you are playing a card, you know exactly which card it is. But in some cases you don't. Those cases mostly happen with 1s (you know it's a playable 1, yet you don't know which) and in ambiguous cluing variants (like rainbow).

When you know about your cards, you can use that information in your decisions. For example, there is no need to save a 2 on chop if you have the same 2 already clued in your hand. Sometimes you can even give play clues on cards that rely on your cards to be played first (if it doesn't ruin tempo).

Point is, the more precise your information is, the more educated your decisions can be.

When you have unknown clued playable cards, you are much more limited. For example, if you have clued playable 1s, you can't clue any 1 in anyone's hand until they are played, because there is a high risk of duplication. If the cards are indeed different, you may lose one turn of tempo because you had to let someone else clue it.

Furthermore, even if you have multiple playable clued cards, if any of them is unknown, you cannot perform priority plays, because you can't evaluate reliably what order to play in.

Therefore, when evaluating what to play, unknown cards take priority over known ones, only because as soon as you play it, you know what it is, and you become more efficient.

Blind plays are still more important

New [Priority](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/19%20-%20Priority.md): Blind Plays -> Unknown cards -> Cards that let somebody else play now -> Cards that let you play now -> 5s -> lowest ranked cards -> most recent card

This technique has to be taken with a grain of salt, and evaluated on a case by case basis. Sometimes, you can infer the information from context, and therefore have no need to play the "unknown" card first. Sometimes, you can't infer the identity, but you can determine that knowing the identity is useless (ex: you have a playable 5. You will never worry about duplication, or miss the chance to clue the (non-existent) next card of its color). Because of this, absolutely no priority moves can be done using the fact that a card was unknown, because it is impossible to figure out if somebody else could get this information from context.

Extra information: [Starting 1s principle](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/12%20-%20Starting%201s.md), which tells you the order to play 1s if you have the choice, only applies to unknown 1s. The technique exists because having many unknown playable 1s is extremely common (as opposed to, for example having many unknown playable 4s). If you have known 1s, you should play the unknown 1s first, regardless of hand order.
