# Occupied Play Clue

<br />

## Technique

While discarding is the last resort move, giving uneeded save clues is also pretty bad. Save clues should be given either when a card is in direct danger of being discarded (the player may choose to discard on their turn), or as a form of stalling when there is nothing better to do.

For example, in the early game, we give pre-emptive save clues a lot.

Once you reach the mid game, if the person with a critical card on chop has something to do on their turn (ex: a playable card), the card is not considered in immediate danger, and you should try to do a more efficient move than a save clue here. Play clues are much better for both efficiency and tempo.

If you do have something better to do, then anyone who sees that "better" play will not expect you to give a save. In this case, you can give a play clue that should look like a save clue, as long as this person is the one that has to interpret it.

For example, you can clue a playable, non-critical red 3 on a chop with the color "red", even if there exists a critical red 4, if the receiver of the clue can see you had better options, because then they can understand it is not a save on the 4, therefore it is playable card and must be the 3.

Same logic goes if you had something to play, and could have let someone else do the save, yet decide to do it. You were occupied, yet decided to waste tempo, so it can't possible be an uneeded save, it must be a play.

Basically if your turn was supposed to be occupied with something else (better clues, playable cards, etc), people should understand that your clue was not a pre-emptive save.

In the same line of thought, you can do Occupied Finesses, Prompts and bluffs.

This time, the person does have the critical 4 on chop, and you clue red. It looks like a save clue. In this case, it doesn't matter if they understand or not. Somebody else has red 3 on finesse position. If that other person can see that you had something better to do (for example, there was something else cluable in the 4 owner's hand that could have been played right away, thus delaying the critical discard). From this they can understand it is in fact not a save, therefore a play clue, therefore somebody has the 3, and they don't see it, so they play it. Once they play, the owner of the 4 can understand what happened and play too.

This move requires people to trust that you usually don't give uneeded saves instead of better clues.
