# Generation Discard

<br />

## Technique

Usually, when you are near the endgame, several piles will be pretty high (3-4). At that point, if somebody picks up a playable card (ex: a 5), you may be tempted to clue it directly, because there are no cards of a higher rank to finesse it with anyway.

Using the logic that, when you are expected to play, you play finesse position (or prompt if possible), you can also finesse high cards that have no higher-rank cards to clue.

If you clue a trash card of a color when only the 5 is playable, from the perspective of whoever has the 5, a misplay will happen, as you just implied that the trash card was the 5. The only way this works is if the clue receiver sees the actual 5 somewhere and knows it is trash, so you are promising a 5 that is playable right now. As always, it can be a prompt or a finesse, or you can even use this as a bluff. The fact that the moves triggers a blind play should be enough for the third person to understant that his card is trash.

By itself, the trash prompt and finesse aren't really useful, as cluing a trash card to get one card played is not better than cluing the card to play directly.

In some situations, this can bring value. For example, if your trash clue also good-touches a useful card. Or maybe, whoever you are giving a known trash to has something important on chop, and this delays their discard (or, if it's obviously the reason, acts as a chop move).

In some variants, it is hard or even impossible to clue the playable card directly, so this can be a good alternative.

<br />

## Example

B just picked up a yellow 5
C has a critical card on chop, and an unclued yellow 4 somewhere else (the other yellow 4 is already played)
A can clue "Yellow" to C.

From B's perspective, it looks like C will attempt to play a trash card as if it was yellow 5 on his turn. It looks like a mistake, but he trusts A to not give such horrible clues. This must mean that he can fix the impending misplay by playing the necessary card for C to figure out his card is trash. B then plays yellow 5.
C understands his yellow is trash, and since the only reason to tell him about a trash instead of cluing the 5 directly in this situation is to give him a known trash discard, he strongly suspects that his current chop is either critical or semi-critical. C chop-moves himself.

	* If somebody discards a semi-critical card, the player playing immediatly after them should not discard unless they see the other copy somewhere, because they may have it and nobody had time to save it.
