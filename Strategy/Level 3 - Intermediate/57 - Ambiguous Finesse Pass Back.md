# Ambiguous Finesse Pass Back

<br />

## Technique

It is very important to have good understanding and mastery of the [Ambiguous Finesse](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/35%20-%20Ambiguous%20Finesse.md) for this technique

When an Ambiguous Finesse happens, the first player with the card will not respond to it, because they see someone else who has it so they don't think they do.

The second player, assuming enough trust, understands that they have it and can blind play. But in some cases, they might prefer to let the first player play it instead.
The reasons one could prefer to let the other player respond are varied.

* Maybe, on them, it is layered, so by having them play, more cards are played for free.
* Maybe the finesse includes multiple card, and the other player must play one of them to unlock another one.
* Maybe the tempo is much better if they play instead of you (can happen close to the endgame)

# Examples

## Example 1: Pass back is required to avoid a misplay

B and C have blue2 on finesse, and B has blue3 on second newest card. A clues D's blue4 to finesse blue2 and blue3.
B sees a 2 and assumes they have the three, they do nothing.
C was waiting for both the 2 and the 3, and sees the 2 wasn't played. They understand that they also have the 2. But if they play, B will then misplay the other b2 because they think it's a b3.
C doesn't play, to signal to B that they also have the 2, and should play it instead.
B plays blue2
B plays blue3.
D plays blue4

In this example, the pass-back was needed. Without doing it, a mistake would have happened.

## Example 2: Pass back is good for effiency

Example: B and C have blue2, but B has blue2 on second newest slot, with another playable card on newest. A clues D's blue3.
B sees C's blue2, and passes, unaware they also have it.
C knows that there are two of them, but sees that on B, it would be layered and get an extra card. They pass-back
B understands that they also have it, and that it is better for them to play. They understand that it is layered behind at least one card. They play starting from newest.

Note: this can be taken to the extreme, if both players are layered. Every pass-back signals that the other player has one more layered card than they thought, and both players can understand exactly how deep their own layer is:
Ex: If C also had it layered behind a card, B could have understood "I am layered 1+ cards, I will pass-back knowing my newest is an unrelated playable for later". Then, if B was actually layered 2 or more cards, C can understand "I am layered behind 1+ cards, I will pass-back to signal it is still better for him to play. Then B knows it's behind 2+ cards, but if it's the same for C, they pass-back again, etc.

Once somebody finally starts playing, both players should have a very good idea of how deep their layer is. If executed well, lots of cards could get played from both of them.

You can take it even further. If you know "I am layered behind 1+ cards" and want to play the blue2, you can start from second newest to get to it faster for tempo (the 3 is playable after all). Therefore, if you want to pass-back, you can do so by playing the newest card, which you know isn't the blue2. Basically,the consecutive pass-backs can be executed by blind playing other unrelated cards to get maximum tempo and efficiency.

Warning: This last example requires incredible trust that players are good with finesses, ambiguous moves, and this move. It can go very wrong very fast if either player screws up.
