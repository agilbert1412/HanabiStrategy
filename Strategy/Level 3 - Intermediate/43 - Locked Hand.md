# Locked Hand and Anxiety Play

<br />

## Technique

Sometimes, an entire player's hand is touched by clues, yet none of the cards are playable. This player can neither play nor discard, so he must give a clue every turn. It is the other player's responsibility to make sure he has at least one clue token available every turn.

In this situation, they are allowed to give [low-value or even zero-value clues.](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/27%20-%20Minimum%20Clue%20Value.md)

When the time comes for them to actually play one of the cards, the other players can signal that by not leaving them a clue. Once that happens, it is a called an Anxiety play. The player has to play something right now, and must choose wisely. He should consider not only the information he has from the clues, but also the contextual information of the clues (when it was saved, what cards could have been "to save" on that turn?). He should figure out exactly which of his cards are possibly playable, and play the newest from that sub group.

The other players should be able to infer similar information, and only give an anxiety play contextual clue when it will result in a successful play.

Sometimes, the other players see different things, and some may not see that they can do a contextual play. Ex: The playable card is red4, saved with 4, at a time when red4 and white4 were critical, but now somebody else picked up white4. The player who is giving the contextual anxiety play clue is the player right before, because they are the one who could have ultimately discarded to make a clue. They are the one who needs to see what is necessary for the anxiety play. In the example, if they had the white4, they can't do it.
