# Distributed Dump Truck

<br />

## Convention
	
The Distributed Dump Truck is one of many types of [Sacrifices](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Categories/Sacrifices.md)

The [Dump Truck](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/50%20-%20Dump%20Truck.md) is a powerful move, it gets 4 or 5 cards played for one life. This is enough efficiency to be worth losing a life and a card for. Fewer cards would not be worth it.

Like most moves, Dump Truck can be lies, as long as it is still worth it. If you ever pretend to do a dump truck (Misplay your chop in the early game for no apparent reason), the player right next to you will start playing, since they don't see any other entirely playable hand. They will think they are being dump trucked. Therefore, they will immediatelyplay their newest card (The dump truck doesn't allow delays on playing)

Now, as soon as they play in the dump truck, everyone else, who also couldn't see an entirely playable hand and were logically planning on playing their own hand due to being the perceived target of the dump truck, can understand that there is actually no entirely playable hand available. The player who played once still doesn't know. To resolve the situation, everybody else will also play their newest card immediately.

To be worth sacrificing a life for, the move must get 4+ cards. Everybody playing their newest card in a 5+ player game would satisfy this criteria, therefore the first player can understand that this was the intention all along.

Basically, you get everyone to do a group Dump Truck, and dump one card each.

Just like the real dump truck, you can also do higher-value variations, each exponentially less likely to be available than the previous one. You misplay the second card to get everyone to blind play two cards, and so on.
