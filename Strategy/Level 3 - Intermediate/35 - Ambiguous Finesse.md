# Ambiguous Finesse

<br />

## Technique

Now that [trust levels](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/34%20-%20Trust%20Level.md) are introduced, this is the first technique that explicitly depends on it.

If you ever see a team mate missing a finesse, and you have low trust in them, you have no choice but to say it again, and lose efficiency and tempo. But if you have high trust in them, specifically if you trust that they don't miss finesses, then you can extrapolate from the fact that they didn't play, that somebody else also has the finessed card on a playable slot,m which they could see, and this is why they didn't play. If you don't also see this second copy, you must have it.

You should only ever give ambiguous finesses if you know that the second player who will get a chance to play has high finesse-trust in the first one, so that it works. If trust is too low, both players will not play, thinking the other is the target, and both will think that the other missed it.

The second player of an ambiguous finesse can be the one who gave the clue! It just happens that they didn't know it was ambiguous at the time. If such a case happens, the finessed player purposely decided to "pass" the finesse to the giver for a reason. Maybe they had something else to play, and this helps balance, or maybe the team is low on clues and this is the equivalent of a gentleman's discard, etc etc.

If you think that the targets's trust is too low for this to work, you should not give it. It can and will end up in a misplay when people start trying to fix it. In this specific case, just wait until one of the targets gives the finesse to the other one instead.

This technique is one of the many that rely not only on trust levels, but also on the player's knowledge of each other's trust levels. Trust levels are neither taboo, secret, or insulting, they are necessary to be able to play efficiently. Don't take it personally if somebody has low trust in you, it's better that you know it, and if you ask them why, you have a chance to improve.

The previous technique didn't mention it, but Trust level are also move-dependent. For example, you can trust that somebody understands finesses very well, yet not trust that they understand bluffs. You trust the person's ability to do things, not the person itself.
