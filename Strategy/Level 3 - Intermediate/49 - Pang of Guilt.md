# Pang of Guilt

<br />

## Technique

Efficiency is critical to victory in Hanabi, and the Finesses (and bluffs) are still our most powerful tools for that.

Many times during the game, players will pick up playable cards. Of course, letting the card sit there for several turns is horrible for tempo. But when you see it the first time, you should look around for a way to finesse it. If you can, do it. If you can't, even if you have nothing else to do other than discarding, you shouldn't clue it directly if somebody else will get a chance to do so before the person's turn.

Maybe your hand contains what is needed to finesse it, and you just stole a finesse from another player. You should feel guilty.

If another player has already ignored the card for a move like discarding, you know they didn't see what was needed to finesse it. Even then, maybe the player on their right can bluff it. If you clue it directly, you're stealing this away from them. You should feel guilty.

Of course, cluing it is better than double discarding, or doing very bad moves, etc. But if you can find anything else to do instead, do it, and let someone have the chance to bluff it.

Common sense applies. for example, if the player in bluff seat has many playable cards, you might prefer that they play, rather than bluff it.

Point is: Get he habit of feeling guilty when you give a direct clue on it. Then, you will be checking for alternatives, and only doing so when you have carefully evaluated that you couldn't do anything better.

Also, if you have the choice between giving a play clue on a finessable card, or on a different card in a non-finessable position, go for the non-finessable one. That seems obvious, but is actually quite a frequent mistake.

Let other players do finesses as much as possible when you can't do them yourself.
