# Finesse Stomp

<br />

## Technique

When a card is finessed, and is expected to get played soon, but someone uses a clue to clue it anyway, we call this "stomping on a finesse".

In beginner games, something extremely common is players stomping on finesses acidentally. They wasted a clue to give a direct clue on a card that was already finessed. Usually, the player either doesn't understand finesses yet, or still has trouble identifying them. Somehow, they missed the finesse and tried giving a good play clue.

Finesse stomps are usually pretty easy to identify as such, because the player who does it will usually do it a lot, until some point, when they "get it" and stop almost completely.

Now, if the player who did it is one you have high trust for, especially for this beginner mistake, then it means something else.

First of all, all cards that are "to be blind played" are to be considered as "clued" when figuring out the focus of a clue. So, if something else was also touched, maybe the clue is not a finesse stomp, but simply a different clue taking into account that you understood the finesse (if they trust you).

Then, in some cases, they will only touch the finessed card, and it can be interpreted as a [Repeat Fix Clue](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/46%20-%20Repeat%20Fix%20Clue.md) on the finessed card.

Basically, once your team reaches a certain level of play, you can stop assuming that finesse stomps are mistake, and actually look for the real meaning behind the clue. If there is a real meaning, then it is not a finesse stomp. If there is not, the mistake is on them.
