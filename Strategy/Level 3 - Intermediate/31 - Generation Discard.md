# Generation Discard

<br />

## Technique

Sometimes, You have a playable card (or many), yet you foresee a big problem coming. There are no clues, and the player two turns after yourself has a critical card on chop. If you play, the player next to you will have to save this card without a clue. They may be able to scream discard, but doing so will lose another critical card (or even a semi-critical), and you don't want that. Or maybe they have nothing to play, so their discard will not be interpreted as a scream discard at all, and may not be enough to save the critical card.

At this point, you can, instead of playing, discard your chop, exactly as if you were doing a Scream Discard. Since the next player can obviously see the critical card of the following player, he knows that this was a generation discard. You generated a clue so that he could save the critical card with a clue, instead of saving it with a discard. The following player may think it was a scream discard, but once they receive the save clue, they will understand that it was actually for them.
