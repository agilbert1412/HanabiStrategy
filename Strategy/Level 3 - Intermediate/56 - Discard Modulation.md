# Discard Modulation

<br />

## Technique

Most discards are "blind" discard, which means you don't know what you are discarding. Just like when playing, you have to trust other players about it. It is everyone's job to take care of giving the discards to the lowest-valued chops.

Every time there is a risk of the next player discarding (you don't see your own hand, so you don't know if there are clues to give there), you should think twice about it. Maybe you should discard instead, depending on the [value of their chop](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/55%20-%20High%20Value%20Cards.md).

Of course, if their chop is low-value (trash), let them do it.

If it is critical or high value, you probably want to discard yourself instead.

If it is medium value, it's situational. Do you believe the previous player would have discarded if yours were higher value?

Basically, estimate if your chop is more important than theirs, and choose which one of you discards.

This entire technique only applies to cases where you can reasonably assume one of you will discard, and if not, that the clue you are about to give couldn't be done better by them. Efficiency and tempo are more important than discard modulation.

If you see the player before you discard when they have a clue to give, it might mean that your chop seems valuable to them. It could also be something else, so you can't take it for granted. But if it happens several times for the same chop, or you have enough information to be sure, you should chop-move yourself, and everyone else should be able to understand that you are chop-moved.

	* When you realize that you are part of an ambiguous finesse, you can either respond to it by playing, or keep ignoring it to pass back the burden of playing to the other person implicated. Do this if you have a good reason to prefer that they respond to it instead of you.
