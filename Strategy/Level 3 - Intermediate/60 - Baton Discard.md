# Baton Discard

<br />

## Technique

Usually, a [Gentleman's Discard](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/25%20-%20Gentleman%20Discard.md) is about a pl a playable card. You discard it (instead of playing) because letting someone else play it is higher value somehow.

But if the card is not playable, you can still do a similar move, and it is very powerful.

You discard as a message "someone else has it [on finesse position unless there is duplication]". The only person who doesn't see it mentally marks the card as that specific identity. They can't play it yet, so they cannot validate the assessment. They need to trust you about it.

Now this move will create a very delayed blind play, as nobody knows exactly when the required cards will get picked up and the specified card will become playable, which means that the move itself must be garanteed unambiguous, otherwise we get information desync. That means you can never perform this move if the card is layered behind other playable cards

This is because if it was, the wrong card would be marked, and the layered blind play would stay "hidden" for potentially many turns, leading to miscommunication. Furthermore, only the specific baton'ed card is marked with an identity. The player is free to discard their other cards when they reach the chop. This means that in case of layer, they may discard the important (and now critical!) card before being able to play.

	* When in a position to do a positional discard that would be understood by itself, you can misplay instead to send the message harder, which will signal that two players can play that specific slot
