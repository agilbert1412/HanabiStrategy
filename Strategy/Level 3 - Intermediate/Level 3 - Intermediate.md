# Level 3 - Intermediate Strategies

## Introduction

Those are intermediate strategies that an experienced player will be introduced to after a reasonable number of games. This section is designed for a player who has a strong understanding of the principles and the most common moves used to win.

Such a player manages to win frequently at his current level. But on many games, he runs into a shuffle that, even if he doesn't make mistakes, will be very challenging and he will most likely not win.

This player also probably started trying out variants (the easier variants) to see what it's about, but will have a lot of trouble getting a good score in them.

The level of strategies in this section will allow players to succeed even when the shuffle is working against them. A player will be introduced to several moves that are useful less often, but allow you to properly deal with different types of hard situations that may come up. Furthermore, some of these moves may prove critical to winning some variants.

## Intermediate Strategies

### [29 - Double Half Bluff](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/29%20-%20Double%20Half%20Bluff.md)
* You can clue a card two-away from playable to finesse the first missing card, and bluff the player on the left of the person who was finessed

### [30 - Positional Discard](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/30%20-%20Positional%20Discard.md)
* If you know that your entire hand is trash, and you want to tell someone what to play, instead of using a clue you can just choose to discard the card on the slot that you want this person to play.

### [31 - Generation Discard](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/31%20-%20Generation%20Discard.md)
* Sometimes you need to discard to generate a clue that the player on your left can use to save a critical card on his left.

### [32 - Occam's Razor](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/32%20-%20Occams%20Razor.md)
* When two interpretations are possible and you have to way to clear things up, assume the safest one, and if neither is safer, assume the simpler one is correct.

### [33 - Accomplice Bluff](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/33%20-%20Accomplice%20Bluff.md)
* You can bluff a player not on your left if your clue could not possibly be misinterpreted by the players between you and the target. Then, they become your accomplices in the bluff.

### [34 - Trust Level](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/34%20-%20Trust%20Level.md)
* Decide at the start of each game your trust level for each team mate and each category of moves, then act accordingly.

### [35 - Ambiguous Finesse](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/35%20-%20Ambiguous%20Finesse.md)
* If two people have the card you want to finesse, and the second one has high trust for the first one, you can do your finesse. The fact that the first doesn't play should be enough to make the other understand what is going on.

### [36 - Double Discard](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/36%20-%20Double%20Discard.md)
* If somebody discards a semi-critical card, the player playing immediatly after them should not discard unless they see the other copy somewhere, because they may have it and nobody had time to save it.

### [37 - Trash Plays](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/37%20-%20Trash%20Plays.md)
* Point to a trash card in someone's hand as if you were giving a play clue, so that the person who has the real copy of the card plays it to prevent the misplay. This can be used as a prompt, finesse or even bluff.

### [38 - 3 Bluff](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/38%20-%203%20Bluff.md)
* You can bluff using a 3, instead of a card 1-away from playable, as long as the clue doesn't match the played card.

### [39 - ]()
