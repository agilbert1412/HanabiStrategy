# Level 3 - Intermediate Strategies

## Introduction

Those are intermediate strategies that an experienced player will be introduced to after a reasonable number of games. This section is designed for a player who has a strong understanding of the principles and the most common moves used to win.

Such a player manages to win frequently at his current level. But on many games, he runs into a shuffle that, even if he doesn't make mistakes, will be very challenging and he will most likely not win.

This player also probably started trying out variants (the easier variants) to see what it's about, but will have a lot of trouble getting a good score in them.

The level of strategies in this section will allow players to succeed even when the shuffle is working against them. A player will be introduced to several moves that are useful less often, but allow you to properly deal with different types of hard situations that may come up. Furthermore, some of these moves may prove critical to winning some variants.

## Intermediate Strategies

### [29 - Double Half Bluff](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/29%20-%20Double%20Half%20Bluff.md)
* You can clue a card two-away from playable to finesse the first missing card, and bluff the player on the left of the person who was finessed

### [30 - Positional Discard](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/30%20-%20Positional%20Discard.md)
* If you know that your entire hand is trash, and you want to tell someone what to play, instead of using a clue you can just choose to discard the card on the slot that you want this person to play.

### [31 - Generation Discard](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/31%20-%20Generation%20Discard.md)
* Sometimes you need to discard to generate a clue that the player on your left can use to save a critical card on his left.

### [32 - Occam's Razor](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/32%20-%20Occams%20Razor.md)
* When two interpretations are possible and you have to way to clear things up, assume the safest one, and if neither is safer, assume the simpler one is correct.

### [33 - Accomplice Bluff](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/33%20-%20Accomplice%20Bluff.md)
* You can bluff a player not on your left if your clue could not possibly be misinterpreted by the players between you and the target. Then, they become your accomplices in the bluff.

### [34 - Trust Level](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/34%20-%20Trust%20Level.md)
* Decide at the start of each game your trust level for each team mate and each category of moves, then act accordingly.

### [35 - Ambiguous Finesse](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/35%20-%20Ambiguous%20Finesse.md)
* If two people have the card you want to finesse, and the second one has high trust for the first one, you can do your finesse. The fact that the first doesn't play should be enough to make the other understand what is going on.

### [36 - Double Discard](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/36%20-%20Double%20Discard.md)
* If somebody discards a semi-critical card, the player playing immediatly after them should not discard unless they see the other copy somewhere, because they may have it and nobody had time to save it.

### [37 - Trash Plays](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/37%20-%20Trash%20Plays.md)
* Point to a trash card in someone's hand as if you were giving a play clue, so that the person who has the real copy of the card plays it to prevent the misplay. This can be used as a prompt, finesse or even bluff.

### [38 - 3 Bluff](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/38%20-%203%20Bluff.md)
* You can bluff using a 3, instead of a card 1-away from playable, as long as the clue doesn't match the played card.

### [39 - Trash Push](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/39%20-%20Trash%20Push.md)
* If a clue only touches known trash cards, and one of them was the chop, you should play your oldest unclued card (which just became your chop).

### [40 - The Endgame](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/40%20-%20Endgame.md)
* Optimal plays in the endgame are extremely hard to calculate, you basically have to brute force the options. As soon as there are few enough cards left to do so, you should.

### [41 - Occupied Play Clue](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/41%20-%20Occupied%20Play%20Clue.md)
* Save clues are bad for efficiency and for tempo, and should only be given when they are needed or there is nothing better to do. If you do have something better to do, but choose to give a clue that looks like an unneeded save clue, it means it isn't one and is actually a play clue.

### [42 - Early Game Principles](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/42%20-%20Early%20Game%20Principles.md)
* Short list of things to look for in the early game.

### [43 - Locked Hand and Anxiety Play](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/43%20-%20Locked%20Hand.md)
* If your entire hand is clued, the other players must leave you clues, and you must use them even for low-value clues. If they don't leave you a clue, it means you can play something.

### [44 - Misplay Cost](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/44%20-%20Misplay%20Cost.md)
* Only fix an impending misplay if the team is on their last life, or if you don't want to lose the card that would be misplayed.

### [45 - Double Bluff](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/45%20-%20Double%20Bluff.md)
* You can use a card that is 2-away from playable for a bluff, but it is a double bluff, and gets the next two unrelated finesse-slot cards played.

### [46 - Repeat Fix Clue](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/46%20-%20Repeat%20Fix%20Clue.md)
* If a clue gives zero new information, doesn't gain tempo and was given as if it was a good clue (not low-value), then it should be interpreted as a fix clue.

### [47 - Finesse Stomp](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/47%20-%20Finesse%20Stomp.md)
* Recluing something that was finessed is called a finesse stomp. With beginners, it is usually a mistake as the person didn't see that it was finessed, but with experienced players, it's a more subtle type of repeat fix clue.

### [48 - Information Priority](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/48%20-%20Information%20Priority.md)
* If you have a choice between playing a card whose identity you know exactly, and one that might be several things, you should play the latter because seeing what it is will help you make better choices afterwards.

### [49 - Pang of Guilt](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/49%20-%20Pang%20of%20Guilt.md)
* Every time you give a clue on a card that is on finesse slot, you should feel a pang of guilt, as you may have taken away a bluff or finesse opportunity from somebody.

### [50 - The Dump Truck](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/50%20-%20Dump%20Truck.md)
* Blind misplay your chop in the early game to signal that somebody can play their entire hand from newest to oldest

### [51 - Distributed Dump Truck](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/51%20-%20Distributed%20Dump%20Truck.md)
* in 5+ player games, pretend to do a dump truck when everyone has a playable card on finesse slot so everyone plays exactly once.

### [52 - Tempo Clue Chop Move](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/52%20-%20Tempo%20Clue%20Chop%20Move.md)
* If a tempo clue happens for no obvious purpose, and you would have had nothing to do other than discarding on this turn, it should be taken as a chop move.

### [53 - Lie Component](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/53%20-%20Lie%20Component.md)
* You can do a soft lie, which is doing a finesse when the expected card is not in a playable position, if you know for sure you can fix before it turns into a mistake and it brings some value through the cards that get played before the fix.

### [54 - Lines](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/54%20-%20Lines.md)
* The future is a tree, and each turn you choose a branch and move on to this subtree. You have to choose the best one according to your current knowledge every turn.

### [55 - High Value Cards](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/55%20-%20High%20Value%20Cards.md)
* Critical cards and playable cards should be treated as very important, and not discarded, while almost-playable cards and 3s should not be carelessly thrown away unless necessary.
