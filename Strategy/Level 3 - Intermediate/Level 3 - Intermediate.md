# Level 3 - Intermediate Strategies

## Introduction

Those are intermediate strategies that an experienced player will be introduced to after a reasonable number of games. This section is designed for a player who has a strong understanding of the principles and the most common moves used to win.

Such a player manages to win frequently at his current level. But on many games, he runs into a shuffle that, even if he doesn't make mistakes, will be very challenging and he will most likely not win.

This player also probably started trying out variants (the easier variants) to see what it's about, but will have a lot of trouble getting a good score in them.

The level of strategies in this section will allow players to succeed even when the shuffle is working against them. A player will be introduced to several moves that are useful less often, but allow you to properly deal with different types of hard situations that may come up. Furthermore, some of these moves may prove critical to winning some variants.

* You can clue a card two-away from playable to finesse the first missing card, and bluff the player on the left of the person who was finessed

### [30 - Positional Discard](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/30%20-%20Positional%20Discard.md)
* If you know that your entire hand is trash, and you want to tell someone what to play, instead of using a clue you can just choose to discard the card on the slot that you want this person to play.
