# Accomplice Bluff

<br />

## Technique

Usually, you only bluff the player on your left, for the reasons mentioned [here](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/15%20-%20The%20Bluff.md).

One of the exceptions is if the person receiving the clue is both the "standard" target (on your left), and knows enough about their hand to understand the play instantly.

For example, if they have negative 1 on their chop (but no clues), and you tell them "yellow" on the chop only, which is a yellow 2, and the next playable yellow card is the 1, they are in a situation where they know for a fact that their chop is a non-1 yellow, and all the other cards are non-yellow. Therefore, they are sure that they do not have the yellow 1. There is zero risk of them playing that card as Yellow 1.

Normally, if they saw the yellow one anywhere, it would be a finesse, and they'd wait for it to play, to play their two. Now, if they don't see the 1 anywhere, they usually should think that either the clued card is the 1, or a two and it's a self-finesse, but now both cases are impossible. At this point, they can notice that the player on their left has a playable unrelated card on finesse position, and that you just forced them into being your bluff accomplice.

They will act as if they saw a yellow 1 somewhere, even if its not, which means they delay playing on the clue for one turn. Every other player thinks they have it, the first one to get a chance plays, which is the one two seats away form the clue giver, and they play an unexpected unrelated playable card. In this specific case, you also saved a 2 on chop, but the clued 2 could be anywhere, it just needs to have negative information sufficient to understand that it's not playable.
