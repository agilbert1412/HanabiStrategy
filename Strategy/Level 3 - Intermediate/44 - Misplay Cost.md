# Misplay Cost (when to give fix clues)

<br />

## Technique

Often, in hanabi (especially beginner games), mistakes will be made. Sometimes, in higher level games, good clues will be given, with a lie component. In both cases, somebody thinks they have a specific card (or one of X possible cards), but it is false. This is called an impending misplay.

It is reasonable to expect that, at some point in the game (maybe now), enough cards will be played and picked up for the person to determine that their card is playable (it's not), and misplay.

But it is also possible that, before that point arrives, enough cards are picked up or played to make it obvious to the person that their information is incorrect. For example, if they believe that their clued red card is red 5 for whatever reason (and it's a trash red instead), then if the red 4 is played, they will misplay, but if anyone picks up the real red 5 before then, they will understand and discard the trash red.

This is why giving fix clues should never be done pre-emptively. The table should wait until the misplay is about to happen to fix it, just in case they can get away with not fixing it at all. It is also much easier to identify fix clues if you assume they are not given pre-emptively (except in situations where the player is allowed to give a low-value clue.

Even when the impending misplay is about to happen right now, you have to evaluate the value of fixing it.

If the player misplays, two things happen:
First, we lose a life. We have 3 of those, and the final score does not depend on the number of lives we have left. If we are on the last life, all misplays need to be fixed.
Second, we lose the card. If the card is critical, we must give the fix clue. If the card is semi-critical and the other copy is not visible, it is also usually worth fixing it to save that card.

If the card is trash or future trash and we have lives left, it may not be worth fixing. Fixing costs a clue, and the person will discard it, generating a clue. clue total is +0, one trash was lost, and two turns of tempo were used. If you don't fix, clue total is +0, you lose one life and one trash, and one turn of tempo was lost. Basically, not fixing saves one turn of tempo at the cost of one life.

If your team is still in a stage where they lose most games to lives lost, you may prefer to save a life than a turn of tempo. But when you reach the point where you get most defeats by lack of efficiency or tempo, you may want to sacrifice that life.

You should also evaluate contextually if, after the misplay, everyone will understand what happened or be confused. Confusion is dangerous in Hanabi, and that alone might be enough to make the fix worth it.

This has to be determined on a case by case basis, but you need to understand that not all impending misplays need to be fixed. In many cases, you can just let the misplay happen and it is good enough.
