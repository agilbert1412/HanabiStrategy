# 3 Bluff

<br />

## Technique

Usually, when you do a bluff, you always use a card that is exactly one-away from playable, with an information that does not match the card that will get played. You'd say blue on a blue2 to bluff a red1, for example.

This not only increases efficiency, because it's like a free finesse (2 cards for 1 clue), but also helps tempo a lot. Every time you make a bluff, you pre emptively save a card (often a 2, but any card is possible except 1), making sure you don't have to save it when it reaches the chop, but also the bluff conventions make sure that the owner knows exactly which card he has, or has a very good idea. (most of the time, you can infer what card the bluffed player was trying to play from the information available and the clue). This means that in addition to never needing to save that card (save clues are bad for tempo), you don't have to clue it again, it will get played naturally eventually.

When you reach that level of play, you have pretty good efficiency and tempo. Now your biggest problem will be a deck shuffle that contains a 3 near the bottom. You don't save the first copy you see, and then, depending on who gets the 4 and the 5, you may be unable to finish.

We could allow save clues on 3s, like we do for 2s, but this has been tested and the lost opportunity of being unable to play clue a 3 on chop is much more problematic than the added value of saving them early on.

Therefore, the 3 bluff has been created. By agreeing to allow "special" bluffs that are not one-away from playable, specifically on 3s, you can save a larger number of first-seen 3s in the early game by using them to bluff, which will improve drastically your chances of not getting bottom-decked by a sneaky 3.

If you can do both types of bluff, you should probably choose the 3-bluff, because the added value of pre-emptively saving a non-critical 3 is very high, especially if the other copy is not visible yet.

As far as "the clue doesn't match the played card" goes, cluing "3" to get a 1 played counts as "doesn't match", using the logic that you need a 2 to get a 3 played. Again, if all conditions are met for it to be possible to be a bluff, then assume it is one over a finesse.
