# Double Positional Misplay

<br />

## Technique
	
The Double Positional Misplay is one of many types of [Sacrifices](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Categories/Sacrifices.md)

It was established that doing a [Positional Display](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/58%20-%20Positional%20Misplay.md) instead of a [Positional Discard](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/30%20-%20Positional%20Discard.md) will convey the message harder to the target.

In the previous case, the goal of this stronger message was to make it obvious in a case where it would be missed otherwise.

But there also exists the case where it would already be obvious, yet the option for the stronger message by misplaying still exists.

This should be interpreted as a double positional, which means that two players can play that specific slot right away.

It may seem like this is only a niche scenario and not very useful on the first look, but when you think about it, you realize that normal [Ambiguous Finesse](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/35%20-%20Ambiguous%20Finesse.md) reasoning would not work here. Once the first potential target has not played, the second one can understand that they were the target and play, but in this scenario, it is either the last turn around the table, or very close to it, which means that the team cannot afford to have the first target not play as soon as they possibly can. This is why this technique is useful. It is rarely used, but when it is, it is absolutely crucial to make sure that the team gets good tempo at the time where that matters the most.
