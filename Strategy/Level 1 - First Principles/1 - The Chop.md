# The Chop

<br />

## Principle
 
At all points of the game, a player's oldest unclued card is called their chop. If they need to discard, they should always discard their chop.
The reason is that your oldest unclued card is the card most likely to be useless in your hand.
If you happen to have any criticial cards, other players can wait until they reach the chop to save them (and they might become playable before then), instead of having to keep track of every entire hand for critical cards.

Your group should agree on which side your chop will be, as a Convention, to make the game easier for everyone, as opposed to having to keep track of which side each individual player has their chop on

<br />

## Exceptions:

* A player has at least one clued card that is known to be useless (exemple: card clued as "1" and all 1s have been played already). This player has a chop, but there is no need to save critical cards on it, because they are expected to discard those cards before unknown cards.
* A player has at least one clue on his entire hand (all cards touched and potentially still useful). This player has no chop, and must not discard. It is the responsibility of other players to leave him at least one clue to give or one card to play until the situation changes.

	* All clues should, within reason, only touch cards that will be played at some point later, or if they are trash, it must be immediately obvious to the receiver.
