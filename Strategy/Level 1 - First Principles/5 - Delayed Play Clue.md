# Delayed Play Clue

<br />

## Principle

When a clue is given and it is not a save clue, then it must be a play clue. This is because otherwise, it would be a useless clue, and we shouldn't give those.

A play clue means that the card that was the focus of the clue is playable right now. The others touched cards are playable now or later, following from good touch principle. A play clue only tells you to play the focus.

Sometimes, a card is playable, not right now, and not in the far future, but very soon.
Every time a play clue is given, all already known cards should be considered as if they were already played to determine which card was just clued.
You can give a play clue "2" on a blue2 even if the blue1 is not played yet, as long as whoever has it already knows about it and will play it soon.

All Play clues should be treated as delayed play clues. You should always wait until all the cards that are potentially required are played before responding to a play clue.

This only applies to cards that were already clued (or otherwise known) when the Play clue happened. Anything clued afterwards is assumed not required for the play clue.

## Examples

The green 3 is playable, another player was clued the red 2, and he knows that it is the red two and is expected to play it very soon, and then you receive a play clue on a 3.
Assuming you know it is not a save clue, you should know that it is playable, but maybe not right now.
In this situation, you should wait until the red 2 is played, which is an event everybody knows will happen very soon, and then play.
At this point, regardless of if the clue was a green3 or a red3, it will work.
