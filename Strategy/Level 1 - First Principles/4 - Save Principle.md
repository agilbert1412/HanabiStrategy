# Save Principle

<br />

## Principle

We define a Critical card as a card that we cannot afford to discard or misplay, because our max score would be reduced. This is the case for all of the 5s at all points of the game, since they are all unique, therefore losing one means we can't complete that pile anymore. This is also the case for any other card that had the other copies discarded, therefore being now unique like 5s are.

Most clues in hanabi are Play clues, which are clues given in order to get one or several cards played. Sometimes, a clue is, instead, a Save Clue. Save clues are used to prevent a player from discarding a critical card. It is of paramount importance that save clues are understood as such, because when they are mistaken for a play clue, not only do misplays happen, but those misplays often implicate the critical card, reducing the max obtainable score for this game.

A Save Clue interpretation has priority over a play clue interpretation, if both are reasonably believable.

A Save Clue is a clue that is focusing the chop (because there is no reason to save a non-chop card, since it is not in danger). When you receive a clue where the focus is the chop, you must look at the discard pile. If the information from the clue makes it that it is possible that the card is critical (and unplayable), you should keep it in hand until you get more information.

Any clue on chop which is "5" could be a save clue. Any clue (number or color) matching a critical card (look at the discard pile) could be a save clue.

If you received a clue that could be a save clue, you keep both interpretations (play and save) in mind, and treat is as a save, until you get more information. For example if you ever see anyone else picking up the critical card that your received clue could have been, you now know it wasn't a save, and you can play it.

## Examples

In this example, Bob receives the clue "yellow" on his chop, and there are two yellow critical cards that it can be, the 2 and the 4. Bob must imagine that this card is either 2 or 4, and not play it.

If it ever becomes impossible that it is a 4 for any reason (ex: he gets a 4 clue in his hand and the card is not touched, he sees someone else drawing the second 4, or he gets confirmation that his card is a 2), he should play the card. If the other 2 ever becomes visible (sombody else draws it), he should figure out that his card must be the 4, and play it as soon as it becomes playable.

	* When a play clue is given, it could require any of the already to-be-played cards to work, so should wait until all potentially required cards are played
