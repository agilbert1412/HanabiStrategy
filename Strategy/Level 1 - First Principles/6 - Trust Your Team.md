# Trust Your Team

<br />

## Principle

In Hanabi, there is a large number of situations that, because you never have perfect information, can look like a mistake or a smart play.
If the play seems more advanced than what you expected from the person who made it, it might be tempting to assume it is a mistake and move on, but this should never be done.

The road to mastering a strategy includes failed attempts at trying it out.
If it is brushed off as a mistake, not only will it be very frustrating for the person (who believes he did it right), and may unmotivate him from trying it again, but it will also not let him learn why he did it wrong (if he did).
Playing into it, on the other hand, will either give them confidence (if it worked), or show them precisely what they did wrong if it fails, because they see the outcome.

The most epic plays in hanabi are the things that you are very unlikely to get the chance to do, because of a lucky card sequence.
Those are also the easiest to not believe when done with your own hand (that you can't see), but you do not want to make your teammates lose his chance at an great play just because you find it unlikely.

If a person has made an habit of making a mistake in a certain situation (ex: someone always misses save clues), it could become tempting to play while taking this expected mistake into account, but it shouldn't be done.
Everyone will eventually get it right, but if the person stops getting the chance to get it right, they will not improve.
Furthermore, if they do get it right, but the team assumes they didn't and waste an extra clue to "fix" it, the person will not be happy about it at all.
Same goes for criticising a team mate for mistakes. Be constructive, explain exactly why what they did was wrong, and keep expecting they are doing it right the next time.
If lack of trust snowballs and disappears, you will never win a game again.
