# Level 1 - First Principles

## Introduction

When playing Hanabi with the standard set of rules, those principles are the strict minimum that players should be aware of in order to try to maximize their goal.
They are our axioms, and pretty much every following technique derives from those principles.
The principles should only change if your group changes the rules of the game or their goal

## First Principles

### [1 - The Chop](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%201%20-%20First%20Principles/1%20-%20The%20Chop.md)
* When you discard an unknown card, always choose the oldest unclued card in your hand. Always pick up new cards on the same side to make this easy to track.

### [2 - Good Touch Principle](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%201%20-%20First%20Principles/2%20-%20The%20Good%20Touch%20Principle.md)
* All clues should, within reason, only touch cards that will be played at some point later, or if they are trash, it must be immediately obvious to the receiver.

### [3 - The Focus](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%201%20-%20First%20Principles/3%20-%20The%20Focus.md)
* For a given clue, only one card is garanteed to be important right now. If the chop was touched, it is the focus. Otherwise, the focus is the newest card that was unclued before that clue.

### [4 - Save Principle](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%201%20-%20First%20Principles/4%20-%20Save%20Principle.md)
* The last copy of a card should not be discarded. Any clue that focuses the chop and could be a Save clue should be considered as such until more information is acquired.
	
### [5 - Delayed Play Clue](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%201%20-%20First%20Principles/5%20-%20Delayed%20Play%20Clue.md)
* When a play clue is given, it could require any of the already to-be-played cards to work, so should wait until all potentially required cards are played

### [6 - Trust Your Team](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%201%20-%20First%20Principles/6%20-%20Trust%20Your%20Team.md)
* Assume your team mates are smart, don't make mistakes, and are choosing the best move on every turn

### [7 - Fix Clue](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%201%20-%20First%20Principles/7%20-%20Fix%20Clue.md)
* If you know a misplay is about to happen right now, spend a clue to fix it with information that contradicts what the person believed to be true. If you get a clue that contradict something you were sure to know, it is a Fix Clue.

### [8 - Discard Principle](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%201%20-%20First%20Principles/8%20-%20Discard%20Principle.md)
* Discarding should be a last resort action, the group is allowed very few discards to be able to get max score. If there is anything better to do, you should do that instead
