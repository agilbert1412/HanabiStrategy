# Minimum Clue Value

<br />

## Technique

In Hanabi, clues are a resource that needs to be used wisely. In most games, we need an efficiency higher than 1 to win. Efficiency is defined as the number of cards that get played per clue, on average.

Therefore, we should always try to get the maximum value out of our clues. This is why moves that get people to blind play are usually very good. Clues that get 2 cards or more played (including "play later", like a Bluff) are good, while moves that get exactly one card played are mediocre, but acceptable.

Since tempo is also very important, we do give 1-value clue often, because waiting for a better chance that may not come any time soon is bad.

This is also why, if somebody picks up a new card that is playable, the first thing you should look for is a way to finesse it. If you can't, this doesn't mean it is impossible. It is possible that you currently hold a card that allows that.

So if the order of play goes A->B->C->D, D just picked up a playable card and you are A, you should check first if B or C have something better to do (like playing). If at least one of them is expected to give a clue or discard, and you would use a 1-value clue to get the new playable card played, you should let them clue the newly picked up card. They might get a chance to get better value by finessing it, or if it is C, they could also Bluff it, and you may already see what they can use to do so, in B's hand.

There are some cases where you are forced to give out a clue, or at least you really should give out a clue, no matter what it is. In those cases, low-value clues are accepted, and in the worst case scenario, zero-value clues can be given.

Of course, if you have something to play, you can just play. Those situations only apply if you have to choose between low-value clue or discarding.

## Low-value Clues

### Cases where you can give them
* When the team is at 7 clues (if you discard, the next player might be forced into a zero-value clue)
* When in the early game

### Examples of Low-value clues

* Cluing something already saved to say that it is now playable
* Stalling by cluing a 5
* Giving someone the color of a clued 5 when they have several of them

<br />

## Zero-Value Clues

### Cases where you can give them (low-value are still better)

* When the team is at 8 clues (can't discard)
* When you are in [Double Discard Position](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%203%20-%20Intermediate/36%20-%20Double%20Discard.md)
* When your entire hand is clued
* When you just received a Scream Discard
* When in the endgame

### Examples of Zero-value clues

* Regiving a known information
* Stomping on a finesse
* Anything clearly useless
