# Level 2 - Beginner Strategies

## Introduction

Those are the first techniques and conventions that a beginner player will be introduced to. This section is designed for a player who has played a few games and understands the rules and the first principles.

Such a player may be starting to realise that the game is much harder than it seems, and probably didn't win a game with max score yet without some level of cheating through table talk.

They may have noticed in [8 - Discard Principle](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%201%20-%20First%20Principles/8%20-%20Discard%20Principle.md) that most gamemodes require an efficiency higher than 1 to be won, yet using only the first principles, the only way to achieve such a thing is through sheer luck in using collateral information.

The level of strategies in this section usually makes the difference between good score and max score, provided the players don't make enough mistakes to lose most games. A player will be introduced to several moves that, although they are purely logical and derive from first principles, are not immediately obvious to the uninitiated.

## Beginner Strategies

### [9 - Early Game](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/9%20-%20Early%20Game.md)
* When you discard an unknown card, always choose the oldest unclued card in your hand. Always pick up new cards on the same side to make this easy to track.

### [10 - The Prompt](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/10%20-%20The%20Prompt.md)
* Give a Play Clue to a higher-ranked card to notice someone that one of their clued cards goes in-between. Play the newest clued card that could be what is needed when someone prompts you.

### [11 - The Finesse](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/11%20-%20The%20Finesse.md)
* Same as Prompt, except none of the clued cards match the expected card. Then play your newest unclued card. Give out finesses to get new unclued cards played for free.

### [12 - Starting 1s](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/12%20-%20Starting%201s.md)
* If you have multiple playable 1s, play the ones that were not in your starting hand, from newest to oldest, then the ones that were in your starting hand, from oldest to newest

### [13 - Reverse Finesse](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/13%20-%20Reverse%20Finesse.md)
* When you receive a play clue, look around to see if it could be a finesse or a prompt. If it could be, delay playing for one turn to see if anyone sitting after you responds to it. Play afterwards.

### [14 - Prompt Finesse](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/14%20-%20Prompt%20Finesse.md)
* If you get prompted, an it works, but isn't the expected card, keep playing the next prompt. If you run out before finding the card, play your finesse position. If you give a finesse that looks like a prompt, make sure the prompted card(s) is/are playable too.

### [15 - The Bluff](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/15%20-%20The%20Bluff.md)
* You can pretend to finesse a card that you don't see to get the player directly on your left to blind play his newest card, even if it is an unrelated card.

### [16 - Finesse or Bluff?](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/16%20-%20Finesse%20Or%20Bluff.md)
* If something that happens fit all the requirements to be a valid bluff, then it is assumed to be one, if not, then it is a finesse
