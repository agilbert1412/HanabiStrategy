# Level 2 - Beginner Strategies

## Introduction

Those are the first techniques and conventions that a beginner player will be introduced to. This section is designed for a player who has played a few games and understands the rules and the first principles.

Such a player may be starting to realise that the game is much harder than it seems, and probably didn't win a game with max score yet without some level of cheating through table talk.

They may have noticed in [8 - Discard Principle](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%201%20-%20First%20Principles/8%20-%20Discard%20Principle.md) that most gamemodes require an efficiency higher than 1 to be won, yet using only the first principles, the only way to achieve such a thing is through sheer luck in using collateral information.

The level of strategies in this section usually makes the difference between good score and max score, provided the players don't make enough mistakes to lose most games. A player will be introduced to several moves that, although they are purely logical and derive from first principles, are not immediately obvious to the uninitiated.

* When you discard an unknown card, always choose the oldest unclued card in your hand. Always pick up new cards on the same side to make this easy to track.
