# Priority Plays

<br />

## Technique

This technique relies heavily on understanding [Priority](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/19%20-%20Priority.md), and the team being reliable when it comes to priority.

Considering the priority of play tip from last time, you can take it to the next level.

If you have several cards to play, and neither of them has the following card of the same color playable right now, then you would follow the normal priority order. Let's say the expected order is you play card A. If you see the card that follows card B somewhere where it could be played, if only the person would try, then you can play card B instead. Playing it signals "The next card of this color is available and playable right now", because that is the only way your priority makes sense. This, exactly like a prompt or a finesse, signals everyone that you see it. Anyone who doesn't see it therefore knows that they have it, and they know that if they try to find it, they will succeed.

This leads to three possible plays.

	1. The Priority Prompt, where the next card is clud somewhere, and the person can just play it if you prompt it with a priority play.
	2. The Priority Finesse, where the next card is not clued, but on someone's finesse slot, so they can blind play it.
	3. The Priority Bluff, where the card isn't actually anywhere, so the player on your lft will blind play their finesse slot and play an unrelated card for free.

All the reasoning, techniques and conditions for the Prompt, Finesse and Bluff apply here. Think of the priority move as the same message as if you had clued the card two ranks higher. You play red3 as a priority move, it's just like you had clued someone's red5 as "red" and signaled that the red4 was somewhere. The logic is the same, except you didn't actually clue anything, and directly signaled the playability of the 4 without having a 5 anywhere.

Priority plays are, of course, only triggered when the card you play looks like it's the wrong priority order to whoever has to react to it. If it was already correct priority, then it is not implying the existence of the next card.

## Warnings

You have to be sure, when you do a priority move, that your other playable card was not needed for the second one. Otherwise you misplay, lose a card, and don't give the info you wanted to give.
Ex: You have an unknown 3 and an unknown 4, both play clued, they could be the same color, and the 4 was actually a delayed play clue.
