# Scream Discard Chop Move

<br />

## Technique

The Trash Chop Move is one of many types of [Chop Moves](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Categories/Chop%20Moves.md).

The two chop moves explained earlier are ways to save multiple unrelated cards with one clue. However, sometimes you don't even have a clue at all.

Typically, discarding should be a last resort. If you have a playable card in your hand (and you know it), you are not expected to discard. If you end up discarding anyway, this means that you discarding right now was actually a necessity, even more important than playing. Discarding does two things, getting rid of a card and getting a clue. Obviously, there is no card that can ever absolutely need to be rid of, so the necessity was for the clue right now. You are "screaming" at the player directly on your left, with your discard, that he absolutely NEEDS a clue on his next turn.

If he was about to play something, that would make no sense. You should only do that when he is about to discard himself, and you want him to use the clue instead. You lost tempo by delaying your own play just so that they would have a clue available, so they absolutely must use it.

This means two things:
* First, their chop is critical and they should chop move. The chop is now saved forever.
* Second, their other cards could also be critical, after all the screamer wants to make sure they use up a clue on this turn at all costs. They should not discard ANYTHING on this turn specifically, and use the clue.

## Exceptions

* If the player discarding needed to generate clues for something unrelated but obvious to the next player, it is not a scream discard. For example, so that they could save the next person's critical cards
* If the next player had playable cards and was not expected to discard anyway, it is not a scream discard
* If the only playable card that was "ignored" for the discard to take place was a blind play (ex: finesse), this can mean that the player also saw the blind playable card in somebody else's hand, and did not think they had something to play at all.

	* If someone clues one or many cards that are obviously trash (and not on chop) and not a single useful card in a clue, they want you to discard those before your other cards. Chop move every card older than the oldest trash that got touched

	* If you are about to play a card, but see it playable (findable) somewhere else (ex: finesse position), you can discard it instead to send a message. Only do it if it brings some value.
