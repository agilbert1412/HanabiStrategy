# Priority

<br />

## Technique

Sometimes, your turn will come and you will have several playable cards. As mentioned earlier, blind plays should be played asap, but sometimes all of the cards are not blind plays. You should not choose randomly.

Here is the best order when deciding what to play on this turn:
	1. Blind plays - Necessary to make sure everyone understands the situation as well as possible. If you have multiple blind plays, do them in the order you received them.
	2. Cards you are certain will allow someone to play something - Not playing those makes the team lose Tempo
	3. Cards you are certain will allow you to play something on the next turn. - This will give you more choice for the next turn, possibly giving you a better option then
	4. 5s - The team will get a free clue!
	5. The lowest-ranked card - Lower piles are more important to play on. It is better to reach the endgame with 1 card missing from 3 piles, than 3 cards from 1 pile.
	6. The most recent playable card - If all else is equal, the convention is to play the newest. This allows us to plan ahead for which card the player will play in all situations.

Any tie should result in you tiebreaking using the next criteria.

In the [Next Technique: Priority Plays](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/20%20-%20Priority%20Plays.md), there will be ways to deviate from priority of play in order to signal information. Of course, this information will only be trustable if the players are reliable when following this priority list.

	* If someone seems to deviate from priority, it is signal, like a play clue, on the card(s) needed for the move to be correct priority. Any card you don't see, you have.
