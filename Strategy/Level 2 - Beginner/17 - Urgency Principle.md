# Urgency Principle

## Technique

As a response to some clues, some players will have to play an unclued card from their hand (this is called a blind play). Most of the times, when a player is blind playing, there is at least one other person who doesn't know that they will blind play, but knows that they may do it. For example, in a finesse, the clued player isn't sure if it is a finesse or a simple "you can already play this" clue until the finessed player does his blind play. He will only know after that player had a chance to blind play. If they blind play, it's a finesse, otherwise it's a simple clue.

When you see a situation where you must blind play something, it is crucial that you do it as soon as you get the chance, because someone else's understanding of the situation might depend on it, and if you delay it, they will have to progress with incomplete, or in the worst case incorrect, information. This is very likely to lead to suboptimal actions on their part, or even a misplay. If a misplay does happen, it is extremely likely to involve a playable card, which makes it even worse.

This means that on most occasions, you have to do your blind play on your very next turn.

## Exceptions

* You get the chance to do a good finesse/bluff, and nobody else will be able to do it if you miss that chance. In this case, the high efficiency move takes priority to avoid missing the chance.
* You have to do something critical (saving a 5 at risk of being discarded, for example), and either no one else can do it, or you have to help whoever will do it (ex: discarding to create a clue for them)

If one of those situations happen, and you do one of those moves, anyone that was giving you one chance to blind play must then give you another chance (one more turn) to perform (or not) your blind play. It is their responsibility to wait, since regardless of whether you had a blind play or not, you chose the best course of action, they can't distinguish between the two cases yet.
