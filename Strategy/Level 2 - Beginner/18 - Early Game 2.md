## Technique

[Early Game Part 1](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/9%20-%20Early%20Game.md)

The players should try to extend the early game as much as possible. This includes "extinguishing" every play clue and save clue on the board before the first discard. Extinguishing means giving a clue to someone that takes care of it.

The goal is that when the early-game ends, discards are perfectly safe, because every player has an almost complete hand where every important card is already clued. Bonus: The piles are as high as possible already, to reduce the number of critical cards in the mid-game.

Things that do not count as ending the early game, as nobody as voluntarily taken the risk of discarding a semi-critical card:
* Misplaying a card. The player was clearly not planning on taking the risk, which means you can't trust that he believed it was safe
* Discarding a known trash. The player did not take a risk at all
* Doing a special discard move to give information. The player chose exactly what he was discarding, therefore even if it was semi-critical, it was not a risk.

If 5 stalls are available, you are not allowed to end the early game until at least one 5 stall has been given.

Since the 5 stall is a last-resort early game move (you only do it instead of discarding). This means that once one player uses the move, they communicate "I don't see anything good left to do". There could still be good moves in their own hand, which is why they choose to stall as opposed to ending the early game.
Once one player has communicated this, if someone else also sees nothing to do, it means there really are no good moves left, they are free to choose between giving a stall or ending the early game, depending on their own judgment and what they see around the table.

Extinguishing every clue does not include the player that played right before you. If this is the only thing you can do, that means that this person specifically did not see anything for you to do, and is expecting you to discard and end the early game. If they let you, that means your chop is safe (or they'd have saved it), so you can choose to end the early game instead of giving them something to do. Both options are acceptable depending on context. For example, you shouldn't clue their finesse position directly if it's the only thing to do, because someone else might be able to finesse it or bluff it.
