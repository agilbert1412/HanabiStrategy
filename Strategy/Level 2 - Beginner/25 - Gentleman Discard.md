# The Gentleman's Discard

<br />

## Technique

Most of the time, if you know that you have a playable card, then you have a pretty good idea of what it is. If you are about to play a card that was clued with the color, you should know exactly which card it is (only one card of that color is playable), and if the early game is over, it is likely that only a few cards with the number you were given are playable, etc etc. Some variants may create some slightly more ambiguous cases, but in general, it stands.

If you know exactly which card it is you are about to play, then you should look around the table for something better to do, as always.
If you don't see another copy of the same card, then of course you shouldn't get rid of yours, as it would be a loss of a playable and known card, which would screw over tempo and efficiency.
If you do see another copy, but the owner doesn't know where it is, then you shouldn't get rid of yours, as it would be a loss of effiency since we need to clue the other one to get it played.
But if you see another copy that wouldn't need a clue to get played, as long as the owner was trying to play it, then you could discard yours to signal that there is another one available and playable.

As always, everyone sees the card too, except the person who has it, so they know they have it and that it is findable, so they start playing until they find it.

Basically, you are being a gentleman by letting them play instead of yourself.

This is a move that is powerful. You are discarding a future known trash card, so you get a clue for free instead of by discarding a risky, possibly semi-critical, chop. Furthermore, you might get one or multiple unrelated cards played for free, if the other person has the desired card layered behind other playable cards ([Layered Gentleman's discard](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/21%20-%20Layers.md)).

On the other hand, this can lose tempo. You are delaying a play after all. If the move gains no value, then you are simply wasting tempo for no reason.
The gentleman's discard should only be performed if at least one of these conditions is true:

1. The tempo loss from the delay is zero. For example, the other person has nothing better to do and would have discarded anyway, the next card of that suit had no chance of being played before the person's turn, etc. In this case, it's a free play clue and a free trash discard, no strings attached. You can decide to do it if you want.

2. The tempo loss from the delay is lesser than the value gain from the discard. For example, it is usually acceptable to lose a turn of tempo if you get two cards or more played from it, assuming you are not at tempo limit.

3. The tempo loss from the delay is compensated by a tempo gain that is equivalent or bigger. For example, if getting that new clue earlier means something else can be done with it to gain tempo, or if the other playable cards played in the layered gentleman's discard actually gains the team a turn of tempo because the next one of that suit is available.

4. The tempo loss from the delay is irrelevant, because the move somehow saves the game. Maybe the player next to you needed a clue to save a critical card, or maybe the player you are gentlemanning was about to discard a critical card, etc.

Reminder: gentleman's discard, like most other moves, should be prompting the copy of the card before finessing it if applicable, which can be used in the layering.

	* If the player on your left is about to discard a critical card and you can't save it, but he expects you to play something, discard instead to let him know he needs to use a clue right now.
