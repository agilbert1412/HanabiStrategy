# Reverse Finesse (and Reverse Prompt)

<br />

## Technique

When you do a finesse or a prompt, you tell person B about a card in their hand that is playable, but that card is not actually playable right now. You do this if the missing card can be played before the person's turn, by person A who will realise they need to do so because everyone knows that card is somewhere, and only person A doesn't see it anywhere. Then, when comes B's turn, they can play the card they were clued, because it is now playable.

The reverse version of this move is pretty much the same thing, except whoever needs to play for the clue to work will get that chance AFTER person B has had a turn.

Of course, if person B just plays their card, it is a mistake because the card is not playable. When B's turn comes, they have to look around the table. They know one information about their card (rank or color), and they know that it is either playable right now OR very soon. They must look for any cards, either on the finesse position or clued (for prompts) around the table that could, if played right now, make their clued card playable. If they find one or several such cards, they must delay playing their card for one turn. If nobody plays one of the "missing" cards, then they can play their clued card, but if somebody plays one, then they are glad they waited.

The Finesse is a move so powerful that it shouldn't be limited by player order. It is much more valuable to be able to finesse anyone from any spot, therefore it is the burden of the clue receiver to make sure any potential finesse target have a chance to play on it, even if they play after.

## Exceptions

If nobody plays any of the playable finessed/prompted cards, or nobody has any such cards, but you know for sure that your card is not playable, yet you also know that the clue was a play clue (example: play clue on a 3, but there are no 2s on the table, and nobody responds to the finesse/prompt), only one possibility remains. You have the missing card, and should play it, either from a clued card (prompt) or your finesse position. Then on the next turn, you play the clued 3.

	* If you get prompted, an it works, but isn't the expected card, keep playing the next prompt. If you run out before finding the card, play your finesse position. If you give a finesse that looks like a prompt, make sure the prompted card(s) is/are playable too.
