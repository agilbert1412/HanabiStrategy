# Tempo Clue

<br />

## Technique

A tempo clue is a clue that touches no new cards, or that the only new cards touched are obviously trash from the point of view of the clue receiver. Their purpose is to get one of the already clued card played earlier than it would have been, if the game had flowed normally. It doesn't get any new cards, only tempo.

A tempo clue is considered a [low-value clue](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/27%20-%20Minimum%20Clue%20Value.md), and should be given in situations where you are allowed to give low-value clues.

For example, someone may have a clue 3 in their hand, whose color they don't know, and that happens to be playable right now. If the game flows normally, this person will play it when all the 2s are on the stacks (or earlier, if they get a prompt or something). A tempo clue would give them their 3's color, so that they play it now, gaining tempo.

Since the card would have been eventually played without any extra clue, the card-value of the clue is zero, but since we gain tempo, the clue has some tempo-value. It is then qualified as a low-value clue (not really, zero, but below 1). The exact value depends on the precise tempo gain. Are the next cards of this color playable? Are they already clued? Does this person has many clued cards, and does this help balance?, etc.

It is hard to put a precise number on the value of a tempo clue. We know that tempo is less valuable than cards, but as cards is a fixed value, tempo value is extremely situational. On the other hand, it is usually easy, comparing two tempo clues, to know which one has the higher value.

Note: When someone gives a clue, always be aware of their situation. If they were allowed to give a low-value clue, or a zero-value clue, take that into account in your interpretation.

## Situations where tempo clues are worth giving even though they are low-value

In those situations, even though you wouldn't be allowed to give any low-value clue, the tempo clue is valuable enough to allow it.

* The tempo clue gets two or more cards played  now, as opposed to waiting for them
* The card was out of order, and there was no way to prompt it later on anyway (it will eventually cost a clue regardless)
* The card was chop moved, because it can't be prompted so will cost a clue later regardless
