# Is it a Finesse Or a Bluff?

<br />

## Technique

When a bluff happens, the person who was bluffed may believe that it was a finesse, and continue playing. Technically, nothing is garanteeing them that their next blind playable card is not actually the correct one.

Obviously, if they do continue playing every time they play something unexpected and it works, then we can never do a bluff anymore, because they will all result in a misplay at some point. All bluffs can plausibly be a layered finesse, but not all layered finesses can be a bluff.

If you just blind played a card, and it was playable, but not the expected one, you should assume that, if finesse and bluff are both possible, it is a bluff.

You can just read the conditions for a bluff [here](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Strategy/Level%202%20-%20Beginner/15%20-%20The%20Bluff.md). If all conditions are met, then assume the move was a bluff. If not, then assume the move is a finesse.

If you attempt a layered finesse on someone in circumstances where a bluff is plausible, then they will see it as such. If your intention is finesse, you should try to fail at least one of the conditions for bluffs (ex: let someone that is not in bluff position do the clue, or choose a clue that matches the card, etc), so that it is clear.

As always, trust your team mates
