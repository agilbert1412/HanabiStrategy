# Trash Chop Move

<br />

## Technique

The Trash Chop Move is one of many types of [Chop Moves](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Categories/Chop%20Moves.md).

At some point in the game, provided the players are progressing, some card types become literally useless, aka known trash. Usually, 1s become known trash before anything else.

Giving someone a clue telling him about trash cards so that he may discard them is generally viewed as a waste of clues and a waste of tempo. Following normal play rythm, those cards would be discarded eventually anyway, as they reach the chop. Therefore, when somebody gives out a clue that points only to known trash cards (ex: cluing 1s after all 1s are played), it means something more than "You can discard those". It has to mean "You should discard those before anything else".

Since you are telling the person about discardable cards, it is not because you want them to discard them (they would have done that anyway). It is because you want them to discard them first. Aka, you want to make sure they don't discard their current chop.

But if you have a clue available and want to save their chop, you could just do a save clue on their chop, and they would understand it as a save. The only exception is when there are multiple cards on the older side that are critical, so saving any of them individually would doom the others.

So when you receive a clue touching one or many trash cards, and no non-trash cards (and obviously none of them were the chop), it should be understood as a trash chop move, which means "Save everything that is older than the oldest trash touched by the clue". If they want you to discard those first, then it logically follows that they want you to save anything that would have been discarded first otherwise.

## Examples

Assuming slot #5 is your chop, if you get clued "1" on slot #2 while there are no longer any useful 1s, you should understand that as a save clue on slots #3, #4 and #5.

	* If the player on your left is about to discard a critical card and you can't save it, but he expects you to play something, discard instead to let him know he needs to use a clue right now.
