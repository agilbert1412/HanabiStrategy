# The Prompt Finesse

<br />

## Technique

When you clue something that can be interpreted as a prompt or a finesse, the other players should interpret it as a prompt. This means that the only player who doesn't see the required card will play the clued cards that could be it in his hand.

But if they play that clued card, and it works, but it happens to not be the card that they needed it to be, then they still know that they have the correct card (you cannot lie on a prompt. You promise them they have the card, and they have to find it). They will then continue playing the clued cards that could be it until there are none. Afterwards, since they still need to find the card but no longer have clued cards that could be it, they will play their finesse position as the new most likely to be it.

This means that if you take the opportunity, if somebody has a playable card on their finesse, you can get it played (and the card next after it) by cluing the next card to somebody else, and if you make your clue correctly, you may also get them to play one or many clued cards that are playable right now, even though they are in another suit, just because you are prompting them first.

Warning: If you can choose your clue to prompt some cards in addition to the finesse, that means you can also acidentally prompt some unplayable cards if you don't pay attention to how you do your finesses. Be careful about that.

## Examples

Bob has, from newest to oldest, red3, blue3 (clued 3), yellow3 (clued 3) and white1. The stacks are white1, red2, blue2, yellow2, green1. Bob has two known 3s, but doesn't know that they are playable yet.
Cindy has red4 in her hand.

Alice can clue "red" to Cindy, to finesse Bob, getting two cards with one clue. Or, Alice can use the Prompt Finesse Technique, clue "4" to Cindy, prompting Bob to play his known 3s first. Bob will know he has red3, will play blue3, then yellow3, then not having any more clued 3s but still having to look for red3, will play the card that was his newest at the time of the clue, and play red3. Alice got 4 cards played with one clue, with two of them being new cards, gaining strong efficiency and tempo.

	* When you receive a play clue, look around to see if it could be a finesse or a prompt. If it could be, delay playing for one turn to see if anyone sitting after you responds to it. Play afterwards.
