# 5 Chop Move

<br />

## Technique

The 5 Chop Move is one of many types of [Chop Moves](https://github.com/agilbert1412/HanabiStrategy/blob/master/Categories/Chop%20Moves.md).

5s are always critical. This means that 5s are disproportionally often involved in save clues compared to other ranks.

Sometimes, a player will have two critical cards as his oldest cards. His current chop is critical, and if he receives a save clue, he will discard another critical card instead, which is just as bad.
In this scenario, is it pretty likely that at least one of the cards is a 5. The 5 Chop Move is a convention designed to take care of the case where one of them is a 5, and it is the second card, not the chop.

The logic is that, since 5s are unique, they are the card that is the most likely to become naturally obviously playable with the flow of the game (you just need to see all unplayable 5s). Furthermore, it is the card that can afford to wait the longest until it gets played, because nothing depends on it to become playable.
Those two factors combined make it that if a play clue on a 5 is misunderstoof as a save, it really isn't a big deal. Comparably, it is of more value to the team to be able to easily take care of the "a critical card is on chop and a 5 is right next to it", because of the rate of occurence of this situation combined with the large downside of not taking care of it, than the value of being able to give a clear play clue "5" on this specific slot when it becomes playable.

This convention therefore goes as such: If you receive a clue "5" that touches a previously-unclued card that is exactly one card away from the chop, instead of being a play clue, it should be interpreted as a save clue. But not just a save clue, because if the goal was just to save the 5, the person would have waited for it to reach the chop. If they couldn't wait for you to discard, it must mean they don't want you to discard. This move is therefore a save on both the 5(s) and the current chop. The player should chop move, and even though no clue touched his chop, he should treat it as if an invisible clue has touched that card, and the new chop is the next oldest unclued card, completely skipping that particular card for the rest of the game when determining where the chop is. This card, according to good touch principle, will be useful at some point and shall not be discarded.

	* If you promise a playable card to someone, you are not promising its exact position. You are only promising that, if they play the most likely card over and over, they will find it before making a mistake. They may play one or even many unrelated playable cards while looking for it, as long as they try the most likely (for a finesse, newest unclued card that existed when the clue was given) every time.

	* If someone clues one or many cards that are obviously trash (and not on chop) and not a single useful card in a clue, they want you to discard those before your other cards. Chop move every card older than the oldest trash that got touched
