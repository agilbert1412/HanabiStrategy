# The Bluff

<br />

## Technique

Finesses are quite efficient, getting many cards played from only one clue.

Whenever you see that a player has just picked up a playable card, you should look around to see if you can finesse it using a higher-ranked card of the same color.
Often, you will not be able to do so. The card you need is nowhere to be found.

But, most of the time, there are cards available that, if clued, would trigger a finesse. Now you have a playable card on finesse position, and, somewhere, a card one-away from playable that could be used to finesse something. Those two cards don't match but their holders don't know that. This is the time to make a fake finesse, called a Bluff.

When you clue the 1-away card, you are promising the table "I see the card we need and it is playable right now". When you do such a promise, you claim to see the card, and that anyone who doesn't see it has it and must play it. In this case, since you are lying, nobody sees the card. This means that EVERYONE thinks that they have it, and are being finessed. They play to blind play on their next turn.

Now, if everyone is planning on playing, then the person who will get the chance first will be the one to play. This means that, when you bluff, the person on your left will attempt to blind play. Everyone else thought they had the card, but since this person has played (and therefore has communicated that THEY don't see the card anywhere), everyone else will understand that it was a bluff and not misplay into it.

IT is only logical that you can only bluff the person sitting directly on your left with this reasoning.

Once the blind play is done, there is just one person left who doesn't necessarily understand. The person who got clued. They might think that the blind played card is precisely the card that was needed for them to play, and misplay the clued card (it is still not playable!). This is why we must add another condition for the bluff to be successful. The Clue must not be compatible with the card that gets blind played. For example, if you get blue2 blind played, you cannot clue red3 with the number 3, because its owner will hear "3" and see a 2 get played, so will think it's a normal finesse. On the other hand, if you clue "red" and a blue card gets played, he can understand that it was a bluff because the clue doesn't match the card.

Bluffs are quite dangerous because you lie to somebody by promising them they have a certain card, even if it is false. Therefore it is very important to only bluff when all the following criteria is met:

1: The clue doesn't match the bluffed card, so that the person who receives the clue can know that it was a bluff after the blind play, and not think that he has the next card of that color instead.

2: The clued card is exactly one-away from a playable card. If it is further, more people will attempt to play into the bluff thinking it's a finesse

3: You are bluffing the player that plays right after yourself (on your left), by cluing a card in another player's hand.

If everyone respects those conditions, then not only do you get 2 cards touched for one clue (high efficiency like a finesse), but the owner of the clued card knows exactly what it is (because it was one-away from playable and unrelated), so this card will get played for free as soon as it is playable. Often, cards 1-away from playable are pretty valuable, and this also "saves" it for later because once touched, it won't get discarded, so there will be no need to look for the other copy. This is especially useful for 2s and 3s in the early game.
